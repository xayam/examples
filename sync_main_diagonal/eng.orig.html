the metamorphosis

chapter i.

one morning, as gregor </p><p>samsa was waking up from anxious dreams, he discovered that </p><p>in bed he had been changed into a monstrous verminous </p><p>bug. he lay on his armour-hard back and saw, </p><p>as he lifted his head up a little, his brown, </p><p>arched abdomen divided up into rigid bow-like sections. from </p><p>this height the blanket, just about ready to slide off </p><p>completely, could hardly stay in place. his numerous legs, pitifully </p><p>thin in comparison to the rest of his circumference, flickered </p><p>helplessly before his eyes.

 what's happened to me,  he </p><p>thought. it was no dream. his room, a proper room </p><p>for a human being, only somewhat too small, lay quietly </p><p>between the four well-known walls. above the table, on </p><p>which an unpacked collection of sample cloth goods was spread </p><p>out—samsa was a travelling salesman—hung the picture which </p><p>he had cut out of an illustrated magazine a little </p><p>while ago and set in a pretty gilt frame. it </p><p>was a picture of a woman with a fur hat </p><p>and a fur boa. she sat erect there, lifting up </p><p>in the direction of the viewer a solid fur muff </p><p>into which her entire forearm had disappeared.

gregor's glance </p><p>then turned to the window. the dreary weather—the rain </p><p>drops were falling audibly down on the metal window ledge—</p><p>made him quite melancholy.  why don't i keep sleeping </p><p>for a little while longer and forget all this foolishness,  </p><p>he thought. but this was entirely impractical, for he was </p><p>used to sleeping on his right side, and in his </p><p>present state he couldn't get himself into this position. </p><p>no matter how hard he threw himself onto his right </p><p>side, he always rolled again onto his back. he must </p><p>have tried it a hundred times, closing his eyes so </p><p>that he would not have to see the wriggling legs, </p><p>and gave up only when he began to feel a </p><p>light, dull pain in his side which he had never </p><p>felt before.

 o god,  he thought,  what a demanding job </p><p>i've chosen! day in, day out, on the road. </p><p>the stresses of selling are much greater than the work </p><p>going on at head office, and, in addition to that, </p><p>i have to cope with the problems of travelling, the </p><p>worries about train connections, irregular bad food, temporary and constantly </p><p>changing human relationships, which never come from the heart. to </p><p>hell with it all!  he felt a slight itching on </p><p>the top of his abdomen. he slowly pushed himself on </p><p>his back closer to the bed post so that he </p><p>could lift his head more easily, found the itchy part, </p><p>which was entirely covered with small white spots—he did </p><p>not know what to make of them and wanted to </p><p>feel the place with a leg. but he retracted it </p><p>immediately, for the contact felt like a cold shower all </p><p>over him.

he slid back again into his earlier position.  </p><p>this getting up early,  he thought,  makes a man quite </p><p>idiotic. a man must have his sleep. other travelling salesmen </p><p>live like harem women. for instance, when i come back </p><p>to the inn during the course of the morning to </p><p>write up the necessary orders, these gentlemen are just sitting </p><p>down to breakfast. if i were to try that with </p><p>my boss, i'd be thrown out on the spot. </p><p>still, who knows whether that mightn't be really good </p><p>for me? if i didn't hold back for my </p><p>parents' sake, i'd have quit ages ago. i would'</p><p>ve gone to the boss and told him just what </p><p>i think from the bottom of my heart. he would'</p><p>ve fallen right off his desk! how weird it is </p><p>to sit up at that desk and talk down to </p><p>the employee from way up there. the boss has trouble </p><p>hearing, so the employee has to step up quite close </p><p>to him. anyway, i haven't completely given up that </p><p>hope yet. once i've got together the money to </p><p>pay off my parents' debt to him—that should take </p><p>another five or six years—i'll do it for </p><p>sure. then i'll make the big break. in any </p><p>case, right now i have to get up. my train </p><p>leaves at five o'clock. 

he looked over at the </p><p>alarm clock ticking away by the chest of drawers.  good </p><p>god!  he thought. it was half past six, and the </p><p>hands were going quietly on. it was past the half </p><p>hour, already nearly quarter to. could the alarm have failed </p><p>to ring? one saw from the bed that it was </p><p>properly set for four o'clock. certainly it had rung. </p><p>yes, but was it possible to sleep through that noise </p><p>which made the furniture shake? now, it's true he'</p><p>d not slept quietly, but evidently he'd slept all </p><p>the more deeply. still, what should he do now? the </p><p>next train left at seven o'clock. to catch that </p><p>one, he would have to go in a mad rush. </p><p>the sample collection wasn't packed up yet, and he </p><p>really didn't feel particularly fresh and active. and even </p><p>if he caught the train, there was no avoiding a </p><p>blow-up with the boss, because the firm's errand </p><p>boy would've waited for the five o'clock train </p><p>and reported the news of his absence long ago. he </p><p>was the boss's minion, without backbone or intelligence. well </p><p>then, what if he reported in sick? but that would </p><p>be extremely embarrassing and suspicious, because during his five years' </p><p>service gregor hadn't been sick even once. the boss </p><p>would certainly come with the doctor from the health insurance </p><p>company and would reproach his parents for their lazy son </p><p>and cut short all objections with the insurance doctor's </p><p>comments; for him everyone was completely healthy but really lazy </p><p>about work. and besides, would the doctor in this case </p><p>be totally wrong? apart from a really excessive drowsiness after </p><p>the long sleep, gregor in fact felt quite well and </p><p>even had a really strong appetite.

as he was thinking </p><p>all this over in the greatest haste, without being able </p><p>to make the decision to get out of bed—the </p><p>alarm clock was indicating exactly quarter to seven—there was </p><p>a cautious knock on the door by the head of </p><p>the bed.

 gregor,  a voice called—it was his mother!— </p><p>it's quarter to seven. don't you want to </p><p>be on your way?  the soft voice! gregor was startled </p><p>when he heard his voice answering. it was clearly and </p><p>unmistakably his earlier voice, but in it was intermingled, as </p><p>if from below, an irrepressibly painful squeaking, which left the </p><p>words positively distinct only in the first moment and distorted </p><p>them in the reverberation, so that one didn't know </p><p>if one had heard correctly. gregor wanted to answer in </p><p>detail and explain everything, but in these circumstances he confined </p><p>himself to saying,  yes, yes, thank you mother. i'm </p><p>getting up right away.  because of the wooden door the </p><p>change in gregor's voice was not really noticeable outside, </p><p>so his mother calmed down with this explanation and shuffled </p><p>off. however, as a result of the short conversation, the </p><p>other family members became aware that gregor was unexpectedly still </p><p>at home, and already his father was knocking on one </p><p>side door, weakly but with his fist.  gregor, gregor,  he </p><p>called out,  what's going on?  and, after a short </p><p>while, he urged him on again in a deeper voice:  </p><p>gregor!  gregor!  at the other side door, however, his sister </p><p>knocked lightly.  gregor? are you all right? do you need </p><p>anything?  gregor directed answers in both directions,  i'll be </p><p>ready right away.  he made an effort with the most </p><p>careful articulation and by inserting long pauses between the individual </p><p>words to remove everything remarkable from his voice. his father </p><p>turned back to his breakfast. however, the sister whispered,  gregor, </p><p>open the door—i beg you.  gregor had no intention </p><p>of opening the door, but congratulated himself on his precaution, </p><p>acquired from travelling, of locking all doors during the night, </p><p>even at home.

first he wanted to stand up quietly </p><p>and undisturbed, get dressed, above all have breakfast, and only </p><p>then consider further action, for—he noticed this clearly—by </p><p>thinking things over in bed he would not reach a </p><p>reasonable conclusion. he remembered that he had already often felt </p><p>a light pain or other in bed, perhaps the result </p><p>of an awkward lying position, which later turned out to </p><p>be purely imaginary when he stood up, and he was </p><p>eager to see how his present fantasies would gradually dissipate. </p><p>that the change in his voice was nothing other than </p><p>the onset of a real chill, an occupational illness of </p><p>commercial travellers, of that he had not the slightest doubt.

</p><p>it was very easy to throw aside the blanket. he </p><p>needed only to push himself up a little, and it </p><p>fell by itself. but to continue was difficult, particularly because </p><p>he was so unusually wide. he needed arms and hands </p><p>to push himself upright. instead of these, however, he had </p><p>only many small limbs which were incessantly moving with very </p><p>different motions and which, in addition, he was unable to </p><p>control. if he wanted to bend one of them, then </p><p>it was the first to extend itself, and if he </p><p>finally succeeded doing what he wanted with this limb, in </p><p>the meantime all the others, as if left free, moved </p><p>around in an excessively painful agitation.  but i must not </p><p>stay in bed uselessly,  said gregor to himself.

at first </p><p>he wanted to get out of bed with the lower </p><p>part of his body, but this lower part—which, by </p><p>the way, he had not yet looked at and which </p><p>he also couldn't picture clearly—proved itself too difficult </p><p>to move. the attempt went so slowly. when, having become </p><p>almost frantic, he finally hurled himself forward with all his </p><p>force and without thinking, he chose his direction incorrectly, and </p><p>he hit the lower bedpost hard. the violent pain he </p><p>felt revealed to him that the lower part of his </p><p>body was at the moment probably the most sensitive.

thus, </p><p>he tried to get his upper body out of the </p><p>bed first and turned his head carefully toward the edge </p><p>of the bed. he managed to do this easily, and </p><p>in spite of its width and weight his body mass </p><p>at last slowly followed the turning of his head. but </p><p>as he finally raised his head outside the bed in </p><p>the open air, he became anxious about moving forward any </p><p>further in this manner, for if he allowed himself eventually </p><p>to fall by this process, it would take a miracle </p><p>to prevent his head from getting injured. and at all </p><p>costs he must not lose consciousness right now. he preferred </p><p>to remain in bed.

however, after a similar effort, while </p><p>he lay there again, sighing as before, and once again </p><p>saw his small limbs fighting one another, if anything worse </p><p>than earlier, and didn't see any chance of imposing </p><p>quiet and order on this arbitrary movement, he told himself </p><p>again that he couldn't possibly remain in bed and </p><p>that it might be the most reasonable thing to sacrifice </p><p>everything if there was even the slightest hope of getting </p><p>himself out of bed in the process. at the same </p><p>moment, however, he didn't forget to remind himself from </p><p>time to time of the fact that calm—indeed the </p><p>calmest—reflection might be better than the most confused decisions. </p><p>at such moments, he directed his gaze as precisely as </p><p>he could toward the window, but unfortunately there was little </p><p>confident cheer to be had from a glance at the </p><p>morning mist, which concealed even the other side of the </p><p>narrow street.  it's already seven o'clock,  he told </p><p>himself at the latest striking of the alarm clock,  already </p><p>seven o'clock and still such a fog.  and for </p><p>a little while longer he lay quietly with weak breathing, </p><p>as if perhaps waiting for normal and natural conditions to </p><p>re-emerge out of the complete stillness.

but then he </p><p>said to himself,  before it strikes a quarter past seven, </p><p>whatever happens i must be completely out of bed. besides, </p><p>by then someone from the office will arrive to inquire </p><p>about me, because the office will open before seven o'</p><p>clock.  and he made an effort then to rock his </p><p>entire body length out of the bed with a uniform </p><p>motion. if he let himself fall out of the bed </p><p>in this way, his head, which in the course of </p><p>the fall he intended to lift up sharply, would probably </p><p>remain uninjured. his back seemed to be hard; nothing would </p><p>really happen to that as a result of the fall. </p><p>his greatest reservation was a worry about the loud noise </p><p>which the fall must create and which presumably would arouse, </p><p>if not fright, then at least concern on the other </p><p>side of all the doors. however, it had to be </p><p>tried.

as gregor was in the process of lifting himself </p><p>half out of bed—the new method was more of </p><p>a game than an effort; he needed only to rock </p><p>with a constant rhythm—it struck him how easy all </p><p>this would be if someone were to come to his </p><p>aid. two strong people—he thought of his father and </p><p>the servant girl—would have been quite sufficient. they would </p><p>have only had to push their arms under his arched </p><p>back to get him out of the bed, to bend </p><p>down with their load, and then merely to exercise patience </p><p>and care that he completed the flip onto the floor, </p><p>where his diminutive legs would then, he hoped, acquire a </p><p>purpose. now, quite apart from the fact that the doors </p><p>were locked, should he really call out for help? in </p><p>spite of all his distress, he was unable to suppress </p><p>a smile at this idea.

he had already got to </p><p>the point where, by rocking more strongly, he maintained his </p><p>equilibrium with difficulty, and very soon he would finally have </p><p>to decide, for in five minutes it would be a </p><p>quarter past seven. then there was a ring at the </p><p>door of the apartment.  that's someone from the office,  </p><p>he told himself, and he almost froze while his small </p><p>limbs only danced around all the faster. for one moment </p><p>everything remained still.  they aren't opening,  gregor said to </p><p>himself, caught up in some absurd hope. but of course </p><p>then, as usual, the servant girl with her firm tread </p><p>went to the door and opened it. gregor needed to </p><p>hear only the first word of the visitor's greeting </p><p>to recognize immediately who it was, the manager himself. why </p><p>was gregor the only one condemned to work in a </p><p>firm where, at the slightest lapse, someone immediately attracted the </p><p>greatest suspicion? were all the employees then collectively, one and </p><p>all, scoundrels? among them was there then no truly devoted </p><p>person who, if he failed to use just a couple </p><p>of hours in the morning for office work, would become </p><p>abnormal from pangs of conscience and really be in no </p><p>state to get out of bed? was it really not </p><p>enough to let an apprentice make inquiries, if such questioning </p><p>was even necessary? must the manager himself come, and in </p><p>the process must it be demonstrated to the entire innocent </p><p>family that the investigation of this suspicious circumstance could be </p><p>entrusted only to the intelligence of the manager? and more </p><p>as a consequence of the excited state in which this </p><p>idea put gregor than as a result of an actual </p><p>decision, he swung himself with all his might out of </p><p>the bed. there was a loud thud, but not a </p><p>real crash. the fall was absorbed somewhat by the carpet </p><p>and, in addition, his back was more elastic than gregor </p><p>had thought. for that reason the dull noise was not </p><p>quite so conspicuous. but he had not held his head </p><p>up with sufficient care and had hit it. he turned </p><p>his head, irritated and in pain, and rubbed it on </p><p>the carpet.

 something has fallen in there,  said the manager </p><p>in the next room on the left. gregor tried to </p><p>imagine to himself whether anything similar to what was happening </p><p>to him today could have also happened at some point </p><p>to the manager. at least one had to concede the </p><p>possibility of such a thing. however, as if to give </p><p>a rough answer to this question, the manager now, with </p><p>a squeak of his polished boots, took a few determined </p><p>steps in the next room. from the neighbouring room on </p><p>the right the sister was whispering to inform gregor:  gregor, </p><p>the manager is here.   i know,  said gregor to himself. </p><p>but he did not dare make his voice loud enough </p><p>so that his sister could hear.

 gregor,  his father now </p><p>said from the neighbouring room on the left,  mr. manager </p><p>has come and is asking why you have not left </p><p>on the early train. we don't know what we </p><p>should tell him. besides, he also wants to speak to </p><p>you personally. so please open the door. he will be </p><p>good enough to forgive the mess in your room. 

in </p><p>the middle of all this, the manager called out in </p><p>a friendly way,  good morning, mr. samsa.   he is not </p><p>well,  said his mother to the manager, while his father </p><p>was still talking at the door,  he is not well, </p><p>believe me, mr. manager. otherwise how would gregor miss a </p><p>train? the young man has nothing in his head except </p><p>business. i'm almost angry that he never goes out </p><p>at night. right now he's been in the city </p><p>eight days, but he's been at home every evening. </p><p>he sits here with us at the table and reads </p><p>the newspaper quietly or studies his travel schedules. it's </p><p>a quite a diversion for him to busy himself with </p><p>fretwork. for instance, he cut out a small frame over </p><p>the course of two or three evenings. you'd be </p><p>amazed how pretty it is. it's hanging right inside </p><p>the room. you'll see it immediately, as soon as </p><p>gregor opens the door. anyway, i'm happy that you'</p><p>re here, mr. manager. by ourselves, we would never have </p><p>made gregor open the door. he's so stubborn, and </p><p>he's certainly not well, although he denied that this </p><p>morning. 

 i'm coming right away,  said gregor slowly and </p><p>deliberately and didn't move, so as not to lose </p><p>one word of the conversation.  my dear lady, i cannot </p><p>explain it to myself in any other way,  said the </p><p>manager;  i hope it is nothing serious. on the other </p><p>hand, i must also say that we business people, luckily </p><p>or unluckily, however one looks at it, very often simply </p><p>have to overcome a slight indisposition for business reasons.   so </p><p>can mr. manager come in to see you now?  asked </p><p>his father impatiently and knocked once again on the door.  </p><p>no,  said gregor. in the neighbouring room on the left </p><p>a painful stillness descended. in the neighbouring room on the </p><p>right the sister began to sob.

why didn't his </p><p>sister go to the others? she'd probably just gotten </p><p>up out of bed now and hadn't even started </p><p>to get dressed yet. then why was she crying? because </p><p>he wasn't getting up and wasn't letting the </p><p>manager in, because he was in danger of losing his </p><p>position, and because then his boss would badger his parents </p><p>once again with the old demands? those were probably unnecessary </p><p>worries right now. gregor was still here and wasn't </p><p>thinking at all about abandoning his family. at the moment </p><p>he was lying right there on the carpet, and no </p><p>one who knew about his condition would've seriously demanded </p><p>that he let the manager in. but gregor wouldn't </p><p>be casually dismissed right way because of this small discourtesy, </p><p>for which he would find an easy and suitable excuse </p><p>later on. it seemed to gregor that it might be </p><p>far more reasonable to leave him in peace at the </p><p>moment, instead of disturbing him with crying and conversation. but </p><p>it was the very uncertainty which distressed the others and </p><p>excused their behaviour.

 mr. samsa,  the manager was now shouting, </p><p>his voice raised,  what's the matter? you are barricading </p><p>yourself in your room, answer with only a yes and </p><p>a no, are making serious and unnecessary troubles for your </p><p>parents, and neglecting (i mention this only incidentally) your commercial </p><p>duties in a truly unheard of manner. i am speaking </p><p>here in the name of your parents and your employer, </p><p>and i am requesting you in all seriousness for an </p><p>immediate and clear explanation. i am amazed. i am amazed. </p><p>i thought i knew you as a calm, reasonable person, </p><p>and now you appear suddenly to want to start parading </p><p>around in weird moods. the chief indicated to me earlier </p><p>this very day a possible explanation for your neglect--it </p><p>concerned the collection of cash entrusted to you a short </p><p>while ago--but in truth i almost gave him my </p><p>word of honour that this explanation could not be correct. </p><p>however, now i see here your unimaginable pig headedness, and </p><p>i am totally losing any desire to speak up for </p><p>you in the slightest. and your position is not at </p><p>all the most secure. originally i intended to mention all </p><p>this to you privately, but since you are letting me </p><p>waste my time here uselessly, i don't know why </p><p>the matter shouldn't come to the attention of your </p><p>parents. your productivity has also been very unsatisfactory recently. of </p><p>course, it's not the time of year to conduct </p><p>exceptional business, we recognize that, but a time of year </p><p>for conducting no business, there is no such thing at </p><p>all, mr. samsa, and such a thing must never be. 

 </p><p>but mr. manager,  called gregor, beside himself and, in his </p><p>agitation, forgetting everything else,  i'm opening the door immediately, </p><p>this very moment. a slight indisposition, a dizzy spell, has </p><p>prevented me from getting up. i'm still lying in </p><p>bed right now. but i'm quite refreshed once again. </p><p>i'm in the midst of getting out of bed. </p><p>just have patience for a short moment! things are not </p><p>going as well as i thought. but things are all </p><p>right. how suddenly this can overcome someone! only yesterday evening </p><p>everything was fine with me. my parents certainly know that. </p><p>actually just yesterday evening i had a small premonition. people </p><p>must have seen that in me. why have i not </p><p>reported that to the office? but people always think that </p><p>they'll get over sickness without having to stay at </p><p>home. mr. manager! take it easy on my parents! there </p><p>is really no basis for the criticisms which you're </p><p>now making against me, and really nobody has said a </p><p>word to me about that. perhaps you have not read </p><p>the latest orders which i shipped. besides, now i'm </p><p>setting out on my trip on the eight o'clock </p><p>train; the few hours' rest have made me stronger. mr. </p><p>manager, do not stay. i will be at the office </p><p>in person right away. please have the goodness to say </p><p>that and to convey my respects to the chief. 

while </p><p>gregor was quickly blurting all this out, hardly aware of </p><p>what he was saying, he had moved close to the </p><p>chest of drawers without effort, probably as a result of </p><p>the practice he had already had in bed, and now </p><p>he was trying to raise himself up on it. actually, </p><p>he wanted to open the door. he really wanted to </p><p>let himself be seen by and to speak with the </p><p>manager. he was keen to witness what the others now </p><p>asking about him would say when they saw him. if </p><p>they were startled, then gregor had no more responsibility and </p><p>could be calm. but if they accepted everything quietly, then </p><p>he would have no reason to get excited and, if </p><p>he got a move on, could really be at the </p><p>station around eight o'clock.

at first he slid down </p><p>a few times on the smooth chest of drawers. but </p><p>at last he gave himself a final swing and stood </p><p>upright there. he was no longer at all aware of </p><p>the pains in his lower body, no matter how they </p><p>might still sting. now he let himself fall against the </p><p>back of a nearby chair, on the edge of which </p><p>he braced himself with his thin limbs. by doing this </p><p>he gained control over himself and kept quiet, for he </p><p>could now hear the manager.

 did you understood a single </p><p>word?  the manager asked the parents,  is he playing the </p><p>fool with us?   for god's sake,  cried the mother </p><p>already in tears,  perhaps he's very ill and we'</p><p>re upsetting him. grete! grete!  she yelled at that point.  </p><p>mother?  called the sister from the other side. they were </p><p>making themselves understood through gregor's room.  you must go </p><p>to the doctor right away. gregor is sick. hurry to </p><p>the doctor. have you heard gregor speak yet?   that was </p><p>an animal's voice,  said the manager, remarkably quietly in </p><p>comparison to the mother's cries.

 anna! anna!' yelled the </p><p>father through the hall into the kitchen, clapping his hands,  </p><p>fetch a locksmith right away!  the two young women were </p><p>already running through the hall with swishing skirts—how had </p><p>his sister dressed herself so quickly?—and yanked open the </p><p>doors of the apartment. one couldn't hear the doors </p><p>closing at all. they probably had left them open, as </p><p>is customary in an apartment where a huge misfortune has </p><p>taken place.

however, gregor had become much calmer. all right, </p><p>people did not understand his words any more, although they </p><p>seemed clear enough to him, clearer than previously, perhaps because </p><p>his ears had gotten used to them. but at least </p><p>people now thought that things were not all right with </p><p>him and were prepared to help him. the confidence and </p><p>assurance with which the first arrangements had been carried out </p><p>made him feel good. he felt himself included once again </p><p>in the circle of humanity and was expecting from both </p><p>the doctor and the locksmith, without differentiating between them with </p><p>any real precision, splendid and surprising results. in order to </p><p>get as clear a voice as possible for the critical </p><p>conversation which was imminent, he coughed a little, and certainly </p><p>took the trouble to do this in a really subdued </p><p>way, since it was possible that even this noise sounded </p><p>like something different from a human cough. he no longer </p><p>trusted himself to decide any more. meanwhile in the next </p><p>room it had become really quiet. perhaps his parents were </p><p>sitting with the manager at the table whispering; perhaps they </p><p>were all leaning against the door listening.

gregor pushed himself </p><p>slowly towards the door, with the help of the easy </p><p>chair, let go of it there, threw himself against the </p><p>door, held himself upright against it—the balls of his </p><p>tiny limbs had a little sticky stuff on them—and </p><p>rested there momentarily from his exertion. then he made an </p><p>effort to turn the key in the lock with his </p><p>mouth. unfortunately it seemed that he had no real teeth. </p><p>how then was he to grab hold of the key? </p><p>but to make up for that his jaws were naturally </p><p>very strong; with their help he managed to get the </p><p>key really moving. he didn't notice that he was </p><p>obviously inflicting some damage on himself, for a brown fluid </p><p>came out of his mouth, flowed over the key, and </p><p>dripped onto the floor.

 just listen for a moment,  said </p><p>the manager in the next room;  he's turning the </p><p>key.  for gregor that was a great encouragement. but they </p><p>all should've called out to him, including his father </p><p>and mother,  come on, gregor,  they should've shouted;  keep </p><p>going, keep working on the lock.  imagining that all his </p><p>efforts were being followed with suspense, he bit down frantically </p><p>on the key with all the force he could muster. </p><p>as the key turned more, he danced around the lock. </p><p>now he was holding himself upright only with his mouth, </p><p>and he had to hang onto the key or then </p><p>press it down again with the whole weight of his </p><p>body, as necessary. the quite distinct click of the lock </p><p>as it finally snapped really woke gregor up. breathing heavily </p><p>he said to himself,  so i didn't need the </p><p>locksmith,  and he set his head against the door handle </p><p>to open the door completely.

because he had to open </p><p>the door in this way, it was already open very </p><p>wide without him yet being really visible. he first had </p><p>to turn himself slowly around the edge of the door, </p><p>very carefully, of course, if he didn't want to </p><p>fall awkwardly on his back right at the entrance into </p><p>the room. he was still preoccupied with this difficult movement </p><p>and had no time to pay attention to anything else, </p><p>when he heard the manager exclaim a loud  oh! —it </p><p>sounded like the wind whistling—and now he saw him, </p><p>nearest to the door, pressing his hand against his open </p><p>mouth and moving slowly back, as if an invisible constant </p><p>force was pushing him away. his mother—in spite of </p><p>the presence of the manager she was standing here with </p><p>her hair sticking up on end, still a mess from </p><p>the night—was looking at his father with her hands </p><p>clasped. she then went two steps towards gregor and collapsed </p><p>right in the middle of her skirts, which were spread </p><p>out all around her, her face sunk on her breast, </p><p>completely concealed. his father clenched his fist with a hostile </p><p>expression, as if he wished to push gregor back into </p><p>his room, then looked uncertainly around the living room, covered </p><p>his eyes with his hands, and cried so that his </p><p>mighty breast shook.

at this point gregor did not take </p><p>one step into the room, but leaned his body from </p><p>the inside against the firmly bolted wing of the door, </p><p>so that only half his body was visible, as well </p><p>as his head, tilted sideways, with which he peeped over </p><p>at the others. meanwhile it had become much brighter. standing </p><p>out clearly from the other side of the street was </p><p>a part of the endless grey-black house situated opposite—</p><p>it was a hospital—with its severe regular windows breaking </p><p>up the facade. the rain was still coming down, but </p><p>only in large individual drops visibly and firmly thrown down </p><p>one by one onto the ground. the breakfast dishes were </p><p>standing piled around on the table, because for his father </p><p>breakfast was the most important meal time in the day, </p><p>which he prolonged for hours by reading various newspapers. directly </p><p>across on the opposite wall hung a photograph of gregor </p><p>from the time of his military service; it was a </p><p>picture of him as a lieutenant, as he, smiling and </p><p>worry free, with his hand on his sword, demanded respect </p><p>for his bearing and uniform. the door to the hall </p><p>was ajar, and since the door to the apartment was </p><p>also open, one could see out into the landing of </p><p>the apartment and the start of the staircase going down.

 </p><p>now,  said gregor, well aware that he was the only </p><p>one who had kept his composure.  i'll get dressed </p><p>right away, pack up the collection of samples, and set </p><p>off. you'll allow me to set out on my </p><p>way, will you not? you see, mr. manager, i am </p><p>not pig-headed, and i am happy to work. travelling </p><p>is exhausting, but i couldn't live without it. where </p><p>are you going, mr. manager? to the office? really? will </p><p>you report everything truthfully? a person can be incapable of </p><p>work momentarily, but that's precisely the best time to </p><p>remember the earlier achievements and to consider that later, after </p><p>the obstacles have been shoved aside, the person will work </p><p>all the more eagerly and intensely. i am really so </p><p>indebted to mr. chief--you know that perfectly well. on </p><p>the other hand, i am concerned about my parents and </p><p>my sister. i'm in a fix, but i'll </p><p>work myself out of it again. don't make things </p><p>more difficult for me than they already are. speak up </p><p>on my behalf in the office! people don't like </p><p>travelling salesmen. i know that. people think they earn pots </p><p>of money and thus lead a fine life. people don'</p><p>t even have any special reason to think through this </p><p>judgment more clearly. but you, mr. manager, you have a </p><p>better perspective on what's involved than other people, even, </p><p>i tell you in total confidence, a better perspective than </p><p>mr. chairman himself, who in his capacity as the employer </p><p>may let his judgment make casual mistakes at the expense </p><p>of an employee. you also know well enough that the </p><p>travelling salesman who is outside the office almost the entire </p><p>year can become so easily a victim of gossip, coincidences, </p><p>and groundless complaints, against which it's impossible for him </p><p>to defend himself, since for the most part he doesn'</p><p>t hear about them at all and only then when </p><p>he's exhausted after finishing a trip and at home </p><p>gets to feel in his own body the nasty consequences, </p><p>which can't be thoroughly explored back to their origins. </p><p>mr. manager, don't leave without speaking a word telling </p><p>me that you'll at least concede that i'm </p><p>a little in the right! 

but at gregor's first </p><p>words the manager had already turned away, and now he </p><p>looked back at gregor over his twitching shoulders with pursed </p><p>lips. during gregor's speech he was not still for </p><p>a moment but kept moving away towards the door, without </p><p>taking his eyes off gregor, but really gradually, as if </p><p>there was a secret ban on leaving the room. he </p><p>was already in the hall, and given the sudden movement </p><p>with which he finally pulled his foot out of the </p><p>living room, one could have believed that he had just </p><p>burned the sole of his foot. in the hall, however, </p><p>he stretched his right hand out away from his body </p><p>towards the staircase, as if some truly supernatural relief was </p><p>waiting for him there.

gregor realized that he must not </p><p>under any circumstances allow the manager to go away in </p><p>this frame of mind, especially if his position in the </p><p>firm was not to be placed in the greatest danger. </p><p>his parents did not understand all this very well. over </p><p>the long years, they had developed the conviction that gregor </p><p>was set up for life in his firm and, in </p><p>addition, they had so much to do nowadays with their </p><p>present troubles that all foresight was foreign to them. but </p><p>gregor had this foresight. the manager must be held back, </p><p>calmed down, convinced, and finally won over. the future of </p><p>gregor and his family really depended on it! if only </p><p>the sister had been there! she was clever. she had </p><p>already cried while gregor was still lying quietly on his </p><p>back. and the manager, this friend of the ladies, would </p><p>certainly let himself be guided by her. she would have </p><p>closed the door to the apartment and talked him out </p><p>of his fright in the hall. but the sister was </p><p>not even there. gregor must deal with it himself.

without </p><p>thinking that as yet he didn't know anything about </p><p>his present ability to move and that his speech possibly—</p><p>indeed probably—had once again not been understood, he left </p><p>the wing of the door, pushed himself through the opening, </p><p>and wanted to go over to the manager, who was </p><p>already holding tight onto the handrail with both hands on </p><p>the landing in a ridiculous way. but as he looked </p><p>for something to hold onto, with a small scream gregor </p><p>immediately fell down onto his numerous little legs. scarcely had </p><p>this happened, when he felt for the first time that </p><p>morning a general physical well being. the small limbs had </p><p>firm floor under them; they obeyed perfectly, as he noticed </p><p>to his joy, and strove to carry him forward in </p><p>the direction he wanted. right away he believed that the </p><p>final amelioration of all his suffering was immediately at hand. </p><p>but at the very moment when he lay on the </p><p>floor rocking in a restrained manner quite close and directly </p><p>across from his mother, who had apparently totally sunk into </p><p>herself, she suddenly sprang right up with her arms spread </p><p>far apart and her fingers extended and cried out,  help, </p><p>for god's sake, help!  she held her head bowed </p><p>down, as if she wanted to view gregor better, but </p><p>ran senselessly back, contradicting that gesture, forgetting that behind her </p><p>stood the table with all the dishes on it. when </p><p>she reached the table, she sat down heavily on it, </p><p>as if absent-mindedly, and did not appear to notice </p><p>at all that next to her coffee was pouring out </p><p>onto the carpet in a full stream from the large </p><p>overturned container.

 mother, mother,  said gregor quietly, and looked over </p><p>towards her. the manager momentarily had disappeared completely from his </p><p>mind. at the sight of the flowing coffee gregor couldn'</p><p>t stop himself snapping his jaws in the air a </p><p>few times . at that his mother screamed all over again, </p><p>hurried from the table, and collapsed into the arms of </p><p>his father, who was rushing towards her. but gregor had </p><p>no time right now for his parents—the manager was </p><p>already on the staircase. his chin level with the banister, </p><p>the manager looked back for the last time. gregor took </p><p>an initial movement to catch up to him if possible. </p><p>but the manager must have suspected something, because he made </p><p>a leap down over a few stairs and disappeared, still </p><p>shouting  huh!  the sound echoed throughout the entire stairwell.

now, </p><p>unfortunately this flight of the manager also seemed to bewilder </p><p>his father completely. earlier he had been relatively calm, for </p><p>instead of running after the manager himself or at least </p><p>not hindering gregor from his pursuit, with his right hand </p><p>he grabbed hold of the manager's cane, which he </p><p>had left behind with his hat and overcoat on a </p><p>chair. with his left hand, his father picked up a </p><p>large newspaper from the table and, stamping his feet on </p><p>the floor, he set out to drive gregor back into </p><p>his room by waving the cane and the newspaper. no </p><p>request of gregor's was of any use; no request </p><p>would even be understood. no matter how willing he was </p><p>to turn his head respectfully, his father just stomped all </p><p>the harder with his feet.

across the room from him </p><p>his mother had pulled open a window, in spite of </p><p>the cool weather, and leaning out with her hands on </p><p>her cheeks, she pushed her face far outside the window. </p><p>between the alley and the stairwell a strong draught came </p><p>up, the curtains on the window flew around, the newspapers </p><p>on the table swished, and individual sheets fluttered down over </p><p>the floor. the father relentlessly pressed forward, pushing out sibilants, </p><p>like a wild man. now, gregor had no practice at </p><p>all in going backwards—it was really very slow going. </p><p>if gregor only had been allowed to turn himself around, </p><p>he would have been in his room right away, but </p><p>he was afraid to make his father impatient by the </p><p>time-consuming process of turning around, and each moment he </p><p>faced the threat of a mortal blow on his back </p><p>or his head from the cane in his father's </p><p>hand. finally gregor had no other option, for he noticed </p><p>with horror that he did not understand yet how to </p><p>maintain his direction going backwards. and so he began, amid </p><p>constantly anxious sideways glances in his father's direction, to </p><p>turn himself around as quickly as possible, although in truth </p><p>this was only done very slowly. perhaps his father noticed </p><p>his good intentions, for he did not disrupt gregor in </p><p>this motion, but with the tip of the cane from </p><p>a distance he even directed gregor's rotating movement here </p><p>and there.

if only his father had not hissed so </p><p>unbearably! because of that gregor totally lost his head. he </p><p>was already almost totally turned around, when, always with this </p><p>hissing in his ear, he just made a mistake and </p><p>turned himself back a little. but when he finally was </p><p>successful in getting his head in front of the door </p><p>opening, it became clear that his body was too wide </p><p>to go through any further. naturally his father, in his </p><p>present mental state, had no idea of opening the other </p><p>wing of the door a bit to create a suitable </p><p>passage for gregor to get through. his single fixed thought </p><p>was that gregor must get into his room as quickly </p><p>as possible. he would never have allowed the elaborate preparations </p><p>that gregor required to orient himself and thus perhaps get </p><p>through the door. on the contrary, as if there were </p><p>no obstacle and with a peculiar noise, he now drove </p><p>gregor forwards. behind gregor the sound at this point was </p><p>no longer like the voice of only a single father. </p><p>now it was really no longer a joke, and gregor </p><p>forced himself, come what might, into the door. one side </p><p>of his body was lifted up. he lay at an </p><p>angle in the door opening. his one flank was sore </p><p>with the scraping. on the white door ugly blotches were </p><p>left. soon he was stuck fast and would have not </p><p>been able to move any more on his own. the </p><p>tiny legs on one side hung twitching in the air </p><p>above, and the ones on the other side were pushed </p><p>painfully into the floor. then his father gave him one </p><p>really strong liberating push from behind, and he scurried, bleeding </p><p>severely, far into the interior of his room. the door </p><p>was slammed shut with the cane, and finally it was </p><p>quiet.

chapter ii.

gregor first woke up from his heavy </p><p>swoon-like sleep in the evening twilight. he would certainly </p><p>have woken up soon afterwards without any disturbance, for he </p><p>felt himself sufficiently rested and wide awake, although it appeared </p><p>to him as if a hurried step and a cautious </p><p>closing of the door to the hall had aroused him. </p><p>light from the electric streetlamps lay pale here and there </p><p>on the ceiling and on the higher parts of the </p><p>furniture, but underneath around gregor it was dark. he pushed </p><p>himself slowly toward the door, still groping awkwardly with his </p><p>feelers, which he now learned to value for the first </p><p>time, to check what was happening there. his left side </p><p>seemed one single long unpleasantly stretched scar, and he really </p><p>had to hobble on his two rows of legs. in </p><p>addition, one small leg had been seriously wounded in the </p><p>course of the morning incident—it was almost a miracle </p><p>that only one had been hurt—and dragged lifelessly behind.

</p><p>by the door he first noticed what had really lured </p><p>him there: it was the smell of something to eat. </p><p>a bowl stood there, filled with sweetened milk, in which </p><p>swam tiny pieces of white bread. he almost laughed with </p><p>joy, for he now had a much greater hunger than </p><p>in the morning, and he immediately dipped his head almost </p><p>up to and over his eyes down into the milk. </p><p>but he soon drew it back again in disappointment, not </p><p>just because it was difficult for him to eat on </p><p>account of his delicate left side—he could eat only </p><p>if his entire panting body worked in a coordinated way—</p><p>but also because the milk, which otherwise was his favourite </p><p>drink and which his sister had certainly placed there for </p><p>that reason, did not appeal to him at all. he </p><p>turned away from the bowl almost with aversion and crept </p><p>back into the middle of the room.

in the living </p><p>room, as gregor saw through the crack in the door, </p><p>the gas was lit, but where, on other occasions at </p><p>this time of day, his father was accustomed to read </p><p>the afternoon newspaper in a loud voice to his mother </p><p>and sometimes also to his sister, at the moment no </p><p>sound was audible. now, perhaps this reading aloud, about which </p><p>his sister had always spoken and written to him, had </p><p>recently fallen out of their general routine. but it was </p><p>so still all around, in spite of the fact that </p><p>the apartment was certainly not empty.  what a quiet life </p><p>the family leads,  said gregor to himself and, as he </p><p>stared fixedly out in front of him into the darkness, </p><p>he felt a great pride that he had been able </p><p>to provide such a life in a beautiful apartment like </p><p>this for his parents and his sister. but how would </p><p>things go if now all tranquillity, all prosperity, all contentment </p><p>should come to a horrible end? in order not to </p><p>lose himself in such thoughts, gregor preferred to set himself </p><p>moving, so he moved up and down in his room.

</p><p>once during the long evening one side door and then </p><p>the other door was opened just a tiny crack and </p><p>quickly closed again. someone presumably needed to come in but </p><p>had then thought better of it. gregor immediately took up </p><p>a position by the living room door, determined to bring </p><p>in the hesitant visitor somehow or other or at least </p><p>to find out who it might be. but now the </p><p>door was not opened any more, and gregor waited in </p><p>vain. earlier, when the door had been barred, they had </p><p>all wanted to come in to him; now, when he </p><p>had opened one door and when the others had obviously </p><p>been opened during the day, no one came any more, </p><p>and the keys were stuck in the locks on the </p><p>outside.

the light in the living room was turned off </p><p>only late at night, and now it was easy to </p><p>establish that his parents and his sister had stayed awake </p><p>all this time, for one could hear clearly as all </p><p>three moved away on tiptoe. now it was certain that </p><p>no one would come into gregor any more until the </p><p>morning. thus, he had a long time to think undisturbed </p><p>about how he should reorganize his life from scratch. but </p><p>the high, open room, in which he was compelled to </p><p>lie flat on the floor, made him anxious, without his </p><p>being able to figure out the reason, for he had </p><p>lived in the room for five years. with a half </p><p>unconscious turn and not without a slight shame he scurried </p><p>under the couch, where, in spite of the fact that </p><p>his back was a little cramped and he could no </p><p>longer lift up his head, he felt very comfortable and </p><p>was sorry only that his body was too wide to </p><p>fit completely under it.

there he remained the entire night, </p><p>which he spent partly in a state of semi-sleep, </p><p>out of which his hunger constantly woke him with a </p><p>start, but partly in a state of worry and murky </p><p>hopes, which all led to the conclusion that for the </p><p>time being he would have to keep calm and with </p><p>patience and the greatest consideration for his family tolerate the </p><p>troubles which in his present condition he was now forced </p><p>to cause them.

already early in the morning—it was </p><p>still almost night—gregor had an opportunity to test the </p><p>power of the decisions he had just made, for his </p><p>sister, almost fully dressed, opened the door from the hall </p><p>into his room and looked eagerly inside. she did not </p><p>find him immediately, but when she noticed him under the </p><p>couch—god, he had to be somewhere or other, for </p><p>he could hardly fly away—she got such a shock </p><p>that, without being able to control herself, she slammed the </p><p>door shut once again from the outside. however, as if </p><p>she was sorry for her behaviour, she immediately opened the </p><p>door again and walked in on her tiptoes, as if </p><p>she was in the presence of a serious invalid or </p><p>a total stranger. gregor had pushed his head forward just </p><p>to the edge of the couch and was observing her. </p><p>would she really notice that he had left the milk </p><p>standing, not indeed from any lack of hunger, and would </p><p>she bring in something else to eat more suitable for </p><p>him? if she did not do it on her own, </p><p>he would sooner starve to death than call her attention </p><p>to the fact, although he had a really powerful urge </p><p>to move beyond the couch, throw himself at his sister'</p><p>s feet, and beg her for something or other good </p><p>to eat. but his sister noticed right away with astonishment </p><p>that the bowl was still full, with only a little </p><p>milk spilled around it. she picked it up immediately, although </p><p>not with her bare hands but with a rag, and </p><p>took it out of the room. gregor was extremely curious </p><p>what she would bring as a substitute, and he pictured </p><p>to himself different ideas about it. but he never could </p><p>have guessed what his sister out of the goodness of </p><p>her heart in fact did. she brought him, to test </p><p>his taste, an entire selection, all spread out on an </p><p>old newspaper. there were old half-rotten vegetables, bones from </p><p>the evening meal, covered with a white sauce which had </p><p>almost solidified, some raisins and almonds, cheese which gregor had </p><p>declared inedible two days earlier, a slice of dry bread, </p><p>and a slice of salted bread smeared with butter. in </p><p>addition to all this, she put down a bowl—probably </p><p>designated once and for all as gregor's—into which </p><p>she had poured some water. and out of her delicacy </p><p>of feeling, since she knew that gregor would not eat </p><p>in front of her, she went away very quickly and </p><p>even turned the key in the lock, so that gregor </p><p>would now observe that he could make himself as comfortable </p><p>as he wished. gregor's small limbs buzzed now that </p><p>the time for eating had come. his wounds must, in </p><p>any case, have already healed completely. he felt no handicap </p><p>on that score. he was astonished at that and thought </p><p>about how more than a month ago he had cut </p><p>his finger slightly with a knife and how this wound </p><p>had hurt enough even the day before yesterday.

 am i </p><p>now going to be less sensitive,  he thought, already sucking </p><p>greedily on the cheese, which had strongly attracted him right </p><p>away, more than all the other foods. quickly and with </p><p>his eyes watering with satisfaction, he ate one after the </p><p>other the cheese, the vegetables, and the sauce. the fresh </p><p>food, by contrast, didn't taste good to him. he </p><p>couldn't bear the smell and even carried the things </p><p>he wanted to eat a little distance away. by the </p><p>time his sister slowly turned the key as a sign </p><p>that he should withdraw, he was long finished and now </p><p>lay lazily in the same spot. the noise immediately startled </p><p>him, in spite of the fact that he was already </p><p>almost asleep, and he scurried back again under the couch. </p><p>but it cost him great self-control to remain under </p><p>the couch, even for the short time his sister was </p><p>in the room, because his body had filled out somewhat </p><p>on account of the rich meal and in the narrow </p><p>space there he could scarcely breathe. in the midst of </p><p>minor attacks of asphyxiation, he looked at her with somewhat </p><p>protruding eyes, as his unsuspecting sister swept up with a </p><p>broom, not just the remnants, but even the foods which </p><p>gregor had not touched at all, as if these were </p><p>also now useless, and as she dumped everything quickly into </p><p>a bucket, which she closed with a wooden lid, and </p><p>then carried all of it out of the room. she </p><p>had hardly turned around before gregor had already dragged himself </p><p>out from the couch, stretched out, and let his body </p><p>expand.

in this way gregor got his food every day, </p><p>once in the morning, when his parents and the servant </p><p>girl were still asleep, and a second time after the </p><p>common noon meal, for his parents were, as before, asleep </p><p>then for a little while, and the servant girl was </p><p>sent off by his sister on some errand or other. </p><p>they certainly would not have wanted gregor to starve to </p><p>death, but perhaps they could not have endured finding out </p><p>what he ate other than by hearsay. perhaps his sister </p><p>wanted to spare them what was possibly only a small </p><p>grief, for they were really suffering quite enough already.

what </p><p>sorts of excuses people had used on that first morning </p><p>to get the doctor and the locksmith out of the </p><p>house gregor was completely unable to ascertain. since they could </p><p>not understand him, no one, not even his sister, thought </p><p>that he might be able to understand others, and thus, </p><p>when his sister was in her room, he had to </p><p>be content with listening now and then to her sighs </p><p>and invocations to the saints. only later, when she had </p><p>grown somewhat accustomed to everything—naturally there could never be </p><p>any talk of her growing completely accustomed to it—gregor </p><p>sometimes caught a comment which was intended to be friendly </p><p>or could be interpreted as such.  well, today it tasted </p><p>good to him,  she said, if gregor had really cleaned </p><p>up what he had to eat; whereas, in the reverse </p><p>situation, which gradually repeated itself more and more frequently, she </p><p>used to say sadly,  now everything has stopped again. 

but </p><p>while gregor could get no new information directly, he did </p><p>hear a good deal from the room next door, and </p><p>as soon as he heard voices, he scurried right away </p><p>to the appropriate door and pressed his entire body against </p><p>it. in the early days especially, there was no conversation </p><p>which was not concerned with him in some way or </p><p>other, even if only in secret. for two days at </p><p>all meal times discussions on that subject could be heard </p><p>on how people should now behave; but they also talked </p><p>about the same subject in the times between meals, for </p><p>there were always at least two family members at home, </p><p>since no one really wanted to remain in the house </p><p>alone and people could not under any circumstances leave the </p><p>apartment completely empty. in addition, on the very first day </p><p>the servant girl—it was not completely clear what and </p><p>how much she knew about what had happened—on her </p><p>knees had begged his mother to let her go immediately, </p><p>and when she said good bye about fifteen minutes later, </p><p>she thanked them for the dismissal with tears in her </p><p>eyes, as if she was receiving the greatest favour which </p><p>people had shown her there, and, without anyone demanding it </p><p>from her, she swore a fearful oath not to betray </p><p>anyone, not even the slightest bit.

now his sister had </p><p>to team up with his mother to do the cooking, </p><p>although that didn't create much trouble because people were </p><p>eating almost nothing. again and again gregor listened as one </p><p>of them vainly invited another one to eat and received </p><p>no answer other than  thank you. i've had enough  </p><p>or something like that. and perhaps they had stopped having </p><p>anything to drink, too. his sister often asked his father </p><p>whether he wanted to have a beer and gladly offered </p><p>to fetch it herself, and when his father was silent, </p><p>she said, in order to remove any reservations he might </p><p>have, that she could send the caretaker's wife to </p><p>get it. but then his father finally said a resounding  </p><p>no,  and nothing more would be spoken about it.

already </p><p>during the first day his father laid out all the </p><p>financial circumstances and prospects to his mother and to his </p><p>sister as well. from time to time he stood up </p><p>from the table and pulled out of the small lockbox </p><p>salvaged from his business, which had collapsed five years previously, </p><p>some document or other or some notebook. the sound was </p><p>audible as he opened up the complicated lock and, after </p><p>removing what he was looking for, locked it up again. </p><p>these explanations by his father were, in part, the first </p><p>enjoyable thing that gregor had the chance to listen to </p><p>since his imprisonment. he had thought that nothing at all </p><p>was left over for his father from that business; at </p><p>least his father had told him nothing to contradict that </p><p>view, and gregor in any case hadn't asked him </p><p>about it. at the time gregor's only concern had </p><p>been to use everything he had in order to allow </p><p>his family to forget as quickly as possible the business </p><p>misfortune which had brought them all into a state of </p><p>complete hopelessness. and so at that point he'd started </p><p>to work with a special intensity and from an assistant </p><p>had become, almost overnight, a travelling salesman, who naturally had </p><p>entirely different possibilities for earning money and whose successes at </p><p>work were converted immediately into the form of cash commissions, </p><p>which could be set out on the table at home </p><p>in front of his astonished and delighted family.

those had </p><p>been beautiful days, and they had never come back afterwards, </p><p>at least not with the same splendour, in spite of </p><p>the fact that gregor later earned so much money that </p><p>he was in a position to bear the expenses of </p><p>the entire family, costs which he, in fact, did bear. </p><p>they had become quite accustomed to it, both the family </p><p>and gregor as well. they took the money with thanks, </p><p>and he happily surrendered it, but the special warmth was </p><p>no longer present. only the sister had remained still close </p><p>to gregor, and it was his secret plan to send </p><p>her next year to the conservatory, regardless of the great </p><p>expense which that necessarily involved and which would be made </p><p>up in other ways. in contrast to gregor she loved </p><p>music very much and knew how to play the violin </p><p>charmingly. now and then during gregor's short stays in </p><p>the city the conservatory was mentioned in conversations with his </p><p>sister, but always only as a beautiful dream, whose realization </p><p>was unimaginable, and their parents never listened to these innocent </p><p>expectations with pleasure. but gregor thought about them with scrupulous </p><p>consideration and intended to explain the matter ceremoniously on christmas </p><p>eve.

in his present situation, such futile ideas went through </p><p>his head, while he pushed himself right up against the </p><p>door and listened. sometimes in his general exhaustion he couldn'</p><p>t listen any more and let his head bang listlessly </p><p>against the door, but he immediately pulled himself together, for </p><p>even the small sound which he made by this motion </p><p>was heard near by and silenced everyone.  there he goes </p><p>on again,  said his father after a while, clearly turning </p><p>towards the door, and only then would the interrupted conversation </p><p>gradually be resumed again.

gregor found out clearly enough—for </p><p>his father tended to repeat himself often in his explanations, </p><p>partly because he had not personally concerned himself with these </p><p>matters for a long time now, and partly also because </p><p>his mother did not understand everything right away the first </p><p>time—that, in spite all bad luck, a fortune, although </p><p>a very small one, was available from the old times, </p><p>which the interest, which had not been touched, had in </p><p>the intervening time gradually allowed to increase a little. furthermore, </p><p>in addition to this, the money which gregor had brought </p><p>home every month—he had kept only a few florins </p><p>for himself—had not been completely spent and had grown </p><p>into a small capital amount. gregor, behind his door, nodded </p><p>eagerly, rejoicing over this unanticipated foresight and frugality. true, with </p><p>this excess money, he could have paid off more of </p><p>his father's debt to his employer and the day </p><p>on which he could be rid of this position would </p><p>have been a lot closer, but now things were doubtless </p><p>better the way his father had arranged them.

at the </p><p>moment, however, this money was not nearly sufficient to permit </p><p>the family to live on the interest payments. perhaps it </p><p>would be enough to maintain the family for one or </p><p>at most two years, that's all. thus, it only </p><p>added up to an amount which one should not really </p><p>draw upon and which must be set aside for an </p><p>emergency. but the money to live on had to be </p><p>earned. now, although his father was old, he was a </p><p>healthy man who had not worked at all for five </p><p>years and thus could not be counted on for very </p><p>much. he had in these five years, the first holidays </p><p>of his trouble-filled but unsuccessful life, put on a </p><p>good deal of fat and thus had become really heavy. </p><p>and should his old mother now perhaps work for money, </p><p>a woman who suffered from asthma, for whom wandering through </p><p>the apartment even now was a great strain and who </p><p>spent every second day on the sofa by the open </p><p>window labouring for breath? should his sister earn money, a </p><p>girl who was still a seventeen-year-old child whose </p><p>earlier life style had been so very delightful that it </p><p>had consisted of dressing herself nicely, sleeping in late, helping </p><p>around the house, taking part in a few modest enjoyments </p><p>and, above all, playing the violin? when it came to </p><p>talking about this need to earn money, at first gregor </p><p>went away from the door and threw himself on the </p><p>cool leather sofa beside the door, for he was quite </p><p>hot from shame and sorrow.

often he lay there all </p><p>night long. he didn't sleep a moment and just </p><p>scratched on the leather for hours at a time. he </p><p>undertook the very difficult task of shoving a chair over </p><p>to the window. then he crept up on the window </p><p>sill and, braced in the chair, leaned against the window </p><p>to look out, obviously with some memory or other of </p><p>the satisfaction which that used to bring him in earlier </p><p>times. actually, from day to day he perceived things with </p><p>less and less clarity, even those a short distance away: </p><p>the hospital across the street, the all-too-frequent sight </p><p>of which he had previously cursed, was not visible at </p><p>all any more, and if he had not been precisely </p><p>aware that he lived in the quiet but completely urban </p><p>charlotte street, he could have believed that from his window </p><p>he was peering out at a featureless wasteland, in which </p><p>the grey heaven and the grey earth had merged and </p><p>were indistinguishable. his attentive sister must have observed a couple </p><p>of times that the chair stood by the window; then, </p><p>after cleaning up the room, each time she pushed the </p><p>chair back right against the window and from now on </p><p>she even left the inner casement open.

if gregor had </p><p>only been able to speak to his sister and thank </p><p>her for everything that she had to do for him, </p><p>he would have tolerated her service more easily. as it </p><p>was, he suffered under it. the sister admittedly sought to </p><p>cover up the awkwardness of everything as much as possible, </p><p>and, as time went by, she naturally got more successful </p><p>at it. but with the passing of time gregor also </p><p>came to understand everything more precisely. even her entrance was </p><p>terrible for him. as soon as she entered, she ran </p><p>straight to the window, without taking the time to shut </p><p>the door, in spite of the fact that she was </p><p>otherwise very considerate in sparing anyone the sight of gregor'</p><p>s room, and yanked the window open with eager hands, </p><p>as if she was almost suffocating, and remained for a </p><p>while by the window breathing deeply, even when it was </p><p>still so cold. with this running and noise she frightened </p><p>gregor twice every day. the entire time he trembled under </p><p>the couch, and yet he knew very well that she </p><p>would certainly have spared him gladly if it had only </p><p>been possible to remain with the window closed in a </p><p>room where gregor lived.

on one occasion—about one month </p><p>had already gone by since gregor's transformation, and there </p><p>was now no particular reason any more for his sister </p><p>to be startled at gregor's appearance—she arrived a </p><p>little earlier than usual and came upon gregor as he </p><p>was still looking out the window, immobile and well positioned </p><p>to frighten someone. it would not have come as a </p><p>surprise to gregor if she had not come in, since </p><p>his position was preventing her from opening the window immediately. </p><p>but she not only did not step inside; she even </p><p>retreated and shut the door. a stranger really might have </p><p>concluded from this that gregor had been lying in wait </p><p>for her and wanted to bite her. of course, gregor </p><p>immediately concealed himself under the couch, but he had to </p><p>wait until the noon meal before his sister returned, and </p><p>she seemed much less calm than usual. from this he </p><p>realized that his appearance was still constantly intolerable to her </p><p>and must remain intolerable in future, and that she really </p><p>had to exert a lot of self-control not to </p><p>run away from a glimpse of only the small part </p><p>of his body which stuck out from under the couch. </p><p>in order to spare her even this sight, one day </p><p>he dragged the sheet on his back and onto the </p><p>couch—this task took him four hours—and arranged it </p><p>in such a way that he was now completely concealed </p><p>and his sister, even if she bent down, could not </p><p>see him. if this sheet was not necessary as far </p><p>as she was concerned, then she could remove it, for </p><p>it was clear enough that gregor could not derive any </p><p>pleasure from isolating himself away so completely. but she left </p><p>the sheet just as it was, and gregor believed he </p><p>even caught a look of gratitude when, on one occasion, </p><p>he carefully lifted up the sheet a little with his </p><p>head to check, as his sister took stock of the </p><p>new arrangement.

in the first two weeks his parents could </p><p>not bring themselves to visit him, and he often heard </p><p>how they fully acknowledged his sister's present work; whereas, </p><p>earlier they had often got annoyed at his sister because </p><p>she had seemed to them a somewhat useless young woman. </p><p>however, now both his father and his mother often waited </p><p>in front of gregor's door while his sister cleaned </p><p>up inside, and as soon as she came out, she </p><p>had to explain in detail how things looked in the </p><p>room, what gregor had eaten, how he had behaved this </p><p>time, and whether perhaps a slight improvement was perceptible. in </p><p>any event, his mother comparatively soon wanted to visit gregor, </p><p>but his father and his sister restrained her, at first </p><p>with reasons which gregor listened to very attentively and which </p><p>he completely endorsed. later, however, they had to hold her </p><p>back forcefully, and when she then cried  let me go </p><p>to gregor. he's my unlucky son! don't you </p><p>understand that i have to go to him?  gregor then </p><p>thought that perhaps it would be a good thing if </p><p>his mother came in, not every day, of course, but </p><p>maybe once a week. she understood everything much better than </p><p>his sister, who, in spite of all her courage, was </p><p>still a child and, in the last analysis, had perhaps </p><p>undertaken such a difficult task only out of childish recklessness.

</p><p>gregor's wish to see his mother was soon realized. </p><p>while during the day gregor, out of consideration for his </p><p>parents, did not want to show himself by the window, </p><p>he couldn't crawl around very much on the few </p><p>square metres of the floor. he found it difficult to </p><p>bear lying quietly during the night, and soon eating no </p><p>longer gave him the slightest pleasure. so for diversion he </p><p>acquired the habit of crawling back and forth across the </p><p>walls and ceiling. he was especially fond of hanging from </p><p>the ceiling. the experience was quite different from lying on </p><p>the floor. it was easier to breathe, a slight vibration </p><p>went through his body, and in the midst of the </p><p>almost happy amusement which gregor found up there, it could </p><p>happen that, to his own surprise, he let go and </p><p>hit the floor. however, now he naturally controlled his body </p><p>quite differently, and he did not injure himself in such </p><p>a great fall. his sister noticed immediately the new amusement </p><p>which gregor had found for himself—for as he crept </p><p>around he left behind here and there traces of his </p><p>sticky stuff—and so she got the idea of making </p><p>gregor's creeping around as easy as possible and thus </p><p>of removing the furniture which got in the way, especially </p><p>the chest of drawers and the writing desk.

but she </p><p>was in no position to do this by herself. she </p><p>did not dare to ask her father to help, and </p><p>the servant girl would certainly not have assisted her, for </p><p>although this girl, about sixteen years old, had courageously remained </p><p>since the dismissal of the previous cook, she had begged </p><p>for the privilege of being allowed to stay permanently confined </p><p>to the kitchen and of having to open the door </p><p>only in answer to a special summons. thus, his sister </p><p>had no other choice but to involve his mother while </p><p>his father was absent. his mother approached gregor's room </p><p>with cries of excited joy, but she fell silent at </p><p>the door. of course, his sister first checked whether everything </p><p>in the room was in order. only then did she </p><p>let his mother walk in. in great haste gregor had </p><p>drawn the sheet down even further and wrinkled it more. </p><p>the whole thing really looked just like a coverlet thrown </p><p>carelessly over the couch. on this occasion, gregor held back </p><p>from spying out from under the sheet. thus, he refrained </p><p>from looking at his mother this time and was just </p><p>happy that she had come.  come on; he’s not </p><p>visible,  said his sister, and evidently led his mother by </p><p>the hand. now gregor listened as these two weak women </p><p>shifted the still heavy old chest of drawers from its </p><p>position, and as his sister constantly took on herself the </p><p>greater part of the work, without listening to the warnings </p><p>of his mother, who was afraid that she would strain </p><p>herself. the work lasted a long time. after about a </p><p>quarter of an hour had already gone by, his mother </p><p>said it would be better if they left the chest </p><p>of drawers where it was, because, in the first place, </p><p>it was too heavy: they would not be finished before </p><p>his father's arrival, and leaving the chest of drawers </p><p>in the middle of the room would block all gregor'</p><p>s pathways, but, in the second place, they could not </p><p>be certain that gregor would be pleased with the removal </p><p>of the furniture. to her the reverse seemed to be </p><p>true; the sight of the empty walls pierced her right </p><p>to the heart, and why should gregor not feel the </p><p>same, since he had been accustomed to the room furnishings </p><p>for a long time and in an empty room would </p><p>feel himself abandoned?

 and is it not the case,  his </p><p>mother concluded very quietly, almost whispering as if she wished </p><p>to prevent gregor, whose exact location she really didn't </p><p>know, from hearing even the sound of her voice—for </p><p>she was convinced that he did not understand her words— </p><p>and isn't it a fact that by removing the </p><p>furniture we're showing that we're giving up all </p><p>hope of an improvement and are leaving him to his </p><p>own resources without any consideration? i think it would be </p><p>best if we tried to keep the room exactly in </p><p>the condition it was in before, so that, when gregor </p><p>returns to us, he finds everything unchanged and can forget </p><p>the intervening time all the more easily. 

as he heard </p><p>his mother's words gregor realized that the lack of </p><p>all immediate human contact, together with the monotonous life surrounded </p><p>by the family over the course of these two months, </p><p>must have confused his understanding, because otherwise he couldn't </p><p>explain to himself how he, in all seriousness, could have </p><p>been so keen to have his room emptied. was he </p><p>really eager to let the warm room, comfortably furnished with </p><p>pieces he had inherited, be turned into a cavern in </p><p>which he would, of course, then be able to crawl </p><p>about in all directions without disturbance, but at the same </p><p>time with a quick and complete forgetting of his human </p><p>past as well? was he then at this point already </p><p>on the verge of forgetting and was it only the </p><p>voice of his mother, which he had not heard for </p><p>a long time, that had aroused him? nothing was to </p><p>be removed—everything must remain. in his condition he could </p><p>not function without the beneficial influences of his furniture. and </p><p>if the furniture prevented him from carrying out his senseless </p><p>crawling about all over the place, then there was no </p><p>harm in that, but rather a great benefit.

but his </p><p>sister unfortunately thought otherwise. she had grown accustomed, certainly not </p><p>without justification, so far as the discussion of matters concerning </p><p>gregor was concerned, to act as an special expert with </p><p>respect to their parents, and so now the mother's </p><p>advice was for his sister sufficient reason to insist on </p><p>the removal, not only of the chest of drawers and </p><p>the writing desk, which were the only items she had </p><p>thought about at first, but also of all the furniture, </p><p>with the exception of the indispensable couch. of course, it </p><p>was not only childish defiance and her recent very unexpected </p><p>and hard won self-confidence which led her to this </p><p>demand. she had also actually observed that gregor needed a </p><p>great deal of room to creep about; the furniture, on </p><p>the other hand, as far as one could see, was </p><p>not of the slightest use.

but perhaps the enthusiastic sensibility </p><p>of young women of her age also played a role. </p><p>this feeling sought release at every opportunity, and with it </p><p>grete now felt tempted to want to make gregor's </p><p>situation even more terrifying, so that then she would be </p><p>able to do even more for him than now. for </p><p>surely no one except grete would ever trust themselves to </p><p>enter a room in which gregor ruled the empty walls </p><p>all by himself. and so she did not let herself </p><p>be dissuaded from her decision by her mother, who in </p><p>this room seemed uncertain of herself in her sheer agitation </p><p>and soon kept quiet, helping his sister with all her </p><p>energy to get the chest of drawers out of the </p><p>room. now, gregor could still do without the chest of </p><p>drawers if need be, but the writing desk really had </p><p>to stay. and scarcely had the women left the room </p><p>with the chest of drawers, groaning as they pushed it, </p><p>when gregor stuck his head out from under the sofa </p><p>to take a look how he could intervene cautiously and </p><p>with as much consideration as possible. but unfortunately it was </p><p>his mother who came back into the room first, while </p><p>grete had her arms wrapped around the chest of drawers </p><p>in the next room and was rocking it back and </p><p>forth by herself, without moving it from its position. his </p><p>mother was not used to the sight of gregor; he </p><p>could have made her ill, and so, frightened, gregor scurried </p><p>backwards right to the other end of the sofa, but </p><p>he could no longer prevent the sheet from moving forward </p><p>a little. that was enough to catch his mother's </p><p>attention. she came to a halt, stood still for a </p><p>moment, and then went back to grete.

although gregor kept </p><p>repeating to himself over and over that really nothing unusual </p><p>was going on, that only a few pieces of furniture </p><p>were being rearranged, he soon had to admit to himself </p><p>that the movements of the women to and fro, their </p><p>quiet conversations, and the scratching of the furniture on the </p><p>floor affected him like a great swollen commotion on all </p><p>sides, and, so firmly was he pulling in his head </p><p>and legs and pressing his body into the floor, he </p><p>had to tell himself unequivocally that he wouldn't be </p><p>able to endure all this much longer. they were cleaning </p><p>out his room, taking away from him everything he cherished; </p><p>they had already dragged out the chest of drawers in </p><p>which the fret saw and other tools were kept, and </p><p>they were now loosening the writing desk which was fixed </p><p>tight to the floor, the desk on which he, as </p><p>a business student, a school student, indeed even as an </p><p>elementary school student, had written out his assignments. at that </p><p>moment he really didn't have any more time to </p><p>check the good intentions of the two women, whose existence </p><p>he had in any case almost forgotten, because in their </p><p>exhaustion they were working really silently, and the heavy stumbling </p><p>of their feet was the only sound to be heard.

</p><p>and so he scuttled out—the women were just propping </p><p>themselves up on the writing desk in the next room </p><p>in order to take a breather—changing the direction of </p><p>his path four times. he really didn't know what </p><p>he should rescue first. then he saw hanging conspicuously on </p><p>the wall, which was otherwise already empty, the picture of </p><p>the woman dressed in nothing but fur. he quickly scurried </p><p>up over it and pressed himself against the glass which </p><p>held it in place and which made his hot abdomen </p><p>feel good. at least this picture, which gregor at the </p><p>moment completely concealed, surely no one would now take away. </p><p>he twisted his head towards the door of the living </p><p>room to observe the women as they came back in.

</p><p>they had not allowed themselves very much rest and were </p><p>coming back right away. grete had placed her arm around </p><p>her mother and held her tightly.  so what shall we </p><p>take now?  said grete and looked around her. then her </p><p>glance met gregor's from the wall. she kept her </p><p>composure only because her mother was there. she bent her </p><p>face towards her mother in order to prevent her from </p><p>looking around, and said, although in a trembling voice and </p><p>too quickly,  come, wouldn't it be better to go </p><p>back to the living room for just another moment?  grete'</p><p>s purpose was clear to gregor: she wanted to bring </p><p>his mother to a safe place and then chase him </p><p>down from the wall. well, let her just try! he </p><p>squatted on his picture and did not hand it over. </p><p>he would sooner spring into grete's face.

but grete'</p><p>s words had immediately made the mother very uneasy. she </p><p>walked to the side, caught sight of the enormous brown </p><p>splotch on the flowered wallpaper, and, before she became truly </p><p>aware that what she was looking at was gregor, screamed </p><p>out in a high pitched raw voice  oh god, oh </p><p>god  and fell with outstretched arms, as if she was </p><p>surrendering everything, down onto the couch and lay there motionless.  </p><p>gregor, you. . .  cried out his sister with a raised fist </p><p>and an urgent glare. since his transformation these were the </p><p>first words which she had directed right at him. she </p><p>ran into the room next door to bring some spirits </p><p>or other with which she could revive her mother from </p><p>her fainting spell. gregor wanted to help as well—there </p><p>was time enough to save the picture—but he was </p><p>stuck fast on the glass and had to tear himself </p><p>loose forcefully. then he also scurried into the next room, </p><p>as if he could give his sister some advice, as </p><p>in earlier times, but then he had to stand there </p><p>idly behind her, while she rummaged about among various small </p><p>bottles. still, she was frightened when she turned around. a </p><p>bottle fell onto the floor and shattered. a splinter of </p><p>glass wounded gregor in the face, some corrosive medicine or </p><p>other dripped over him. now, without lingering any longer, grete </p><p>took as many small bottles as she could hold and </p><p>ran with them into her mother. she slammed the door </p><p>shut with her foot. gregor was now shut off from </p><p>his mother, who was perhaps near death, thanks to him. </p><p>he could not open the door, and he did not </p><p>want to chase away his sister who had to remain </p><p>with her mother. at this point he had nothing to </p><p>do but wait, and overwhelmed with self-reproach and worry, </p><p>he began to creep and crawl over everything: walls, furniture, </p><p>and ceiling. finally, in his despair, as the entire room </p><p>started to spin around him, he fell onto the middle </p><p>of the large table.

a short time elapsed. gregor lay </p><p>there limply. all around was still. perhaps that was a </p><p>good sign. then there was ring at the door. the </p><p>servant girl was naturally shut up in her kitchen, and </p><p>therefore grete had to go to open the door. the </p><p>father had arrived.  what's happened?  were his first words. </p><p>grete's appearance had told him everything. grete replied with </p><p>a dull voice; evidently she was pressing her face into </p><p>her father's chest:  mother fainted, but she's getting </p><p>better now. gregor has broken loose.   yes, i have expected </p><p>that,  said his father,  i always told you that, but </p><p>you women don't want to listen. 

it was clear </p><p>to gregor that his father had badly misunderstood grete's </p><p>short message and was assuming that gregor had committed some </p><p>violent crime or other. thus, gregor now had to find </p><p>his father to calm him down, for he had neither </p><p>the time nor the ability to explain things to him. </p><p>and so he rushed away to the door of his </p><p>room and pushed himself against it, so that his father </p><p>could see right away as he entered from the hall </p><p>that gregor fully intended to return at once to his </p><p>room, that it was not necessary to drive him back, </p><p>but that one only needed to open the door, and </p><p>he would disappear immediately.

but his father was not in </p><p>the mood to observe such niceties.  ah,  he yelled as </p><p>soon as he entered, with a tone as if he </p><p>were all at once angry and pleased. gregor pulled his </p><p>head back from the door and raised it in the </p><p>direction of his father. he had not really pictured his </p><p>father as he now stood there. of course, what with </p><p>his new style of creeping all around, he had in </p><p>the past while neglected to pay attention to what was </p><p>going on in the rest of the apartment, as he </p><p>had done before, and really should have grasped the fact </p><p>that he would encounter different conditions. nevertheless, nevertheless, was that </p><p>still his father? was that the same man who had </p><p>lain exhausted and buried in bed in earlier days when </p><p>gregor was setting out on a business trip, who had </p><p>received him on the evenings of his return in a </p><p>sleeping gown and arm chair, totally incapable of standing up, </p><p>who had only lifted his arm as a sign of </p><p>happiness, and who in their rare strolls together a few </p><p>sundays a year and on the important holidays made his </p><p>way slowly forwards between gregor and his mother—who themselves </p><p>moved slowly—always a bit more slowly than them, bundled </p><p>up in his old coat, all the time setting down </p><p>his walking stick carefully, and who, when he had wanted </p><p>to say something, almost always stood still and gathered his </p><p>entourage around him?

but now he was standing up really </p><p>straight, dressed in a tight-fitting blue uniform with gold </p><p>buttons, like the ones servants wear in a banking company. </p><p>above the high stiff collar of his jacket his firm </p><p>double chin stuck out prominently, beneath his bushy eyebrows the </p><p>glance of his black eyes was freshly penetrating and alert, </p><p>his otherwise dishevelled white hair was combed down into a </p><p>carefully exact shining part. he threw his cap, on which </p><p>a gold monogram, apparently the symbol of the bank, was </p><p>affixed, in an arc across the entire room onto the </p><p>sofa and moved, throwing back the edge of the long </p><p>coat of his uniform, with his hands in his trouser </p><p>pockets and a grim face, right up to gregor.

he </p><p>really didn't know what he had in mind, but </p><p>he raised his foot uncommonly high anyway, and gregor was </p><p>astonished at the gigantic size of the sole of his </p><p>boot. however, he did not linger on that point. for </p><p>he knew from the first day of his new life </p><p>that, as far as he was concerned, his father considered </p><p>the greatest force the only appropriate response. and so he </p><p>scurried away from his father, stopped when his father remained </p><p>standing, and scampered forward again when his father merely stirred. </p><p>in this way they made their way around the room </p><p>repeatedly, without anything decisive taking place. in fact, because of </p><p>the slow pace, it didn't look like a chase. </p><p>gregor remained on the floor for the time being, especially </p><p>since he was afraid that his father could take a </p><p>flight up onto the wall or the ceiling as an </p><p>act of real malice. at any event, gregor had to </p><p>tell himself that he couldn't keep up this running </p><p>around for a long time, because whenever his father took </p><p>a single step, he had to go through an enormous </p><p>number of movements. already he was starting to suffer from </p><p>a shortage of breath, just as in his earlier days </p><p>when his lungs had been quite unreliable. as he now </p><p>staggered around in this way in order to gather all </p><p>his energies for running, hardly keeping his eyes open and </p><p>feeling so listless that he had no notion at all </p><p>of any escape other than by running and had almost </p><p>already forgotten that the walls were available to him, although </p><p>they were obstructed by carefully carved furniture full of sharp </p><p>points and spikes, at that moment something or other thrown </p><p>casually flew down close by and rolled in front of </p><p>him. it was an apple. immediately a second one flew </p><p>after it. gregor stood still in fright. further running away </p><p>was useless, for his father had decided to bombard him.

</p><p>from the fruit bowl on the sideboard his father had </p><p>filled his pockets. and now, without for the moment taking </p><p>accurate aim, he was throwing apple after apple. these small </p><p>red apples rolled around on the floor, as if electrified, </p><p>and collided with each other. a weakly thrown apple grazed </p><p>gregor's back but skidded off harmlessly. however, another thrown </p><p>immediately after that one drove into gregor's back really </p><p>hard. gregor wanted to drag himself off, as if the </p><p>unexpected and incredible pain would go away if he changed </p><p>his position. but he felt as if he was nailed </p><p>in place and lay stretched out completely confused in all </p><p>his senses. only with his final glance did he notice </p><p>how the door of his room was pulled open and </p><p>how, right in front of his sister—who was yelling—</p><p>his mother ran out in her undergarments, for his sister </p><p>had undressed her in order to give her some freedom </p><p>to breathe in her fainting spell, and how his mother </p><p>then ran up to his father, on the way her </p><p>tied up skirts slipped toward the floor one after the </p><p>other, and how, tripping over her skirts, she hurled herself </p><p>onto his father and, throwing her arms around him, in </p><p>complete union with him--but at this moment gregor's </p><p>powers of sight gave way--as her hands reached to </p><p>the back of his father's head and she begged </p><p>him to spare gregor's life.

chapter iii.

gregor's </p><p>serious wound, from which he suffered for over a month—</p><p>since no one ventured to remove the apple, it remained </p><p>in his flesh as a visible reminder—seemed by itself </p><p>to have reminded the father that, in spite of his </p><p>present unhappy and hateful appearance, gregor was a member of </p><p>the family, something one should not treat as an enemy, </p><p>and that it was, on the contrary, a requirement of </p><p>family duty to suppress one's aversion and to endure--</p><p>nothing else, just endure. and if through his wound gregor </p><p>had now apparently lost for good his ability to move </p><p>and for the time being needed many, many minutes to </p><p>crawl across his room, like an aged invalid—so far </p><p>as creeping up high was concerned, that was unimaginable—nevertheless </p><p>for this worsening of his condition, in his opinion, he </p><p>did get completely satisfactory compensation, because every day towards evening </p><p>the door to the living room, which he was in </p><p>the habit of keeping a sharp eye on even one </p><p>or two hours beforehand, was opened, so that he, lying </p><p>down in the darkness of his room, invisible from the </p><p>living room, could see the entire family at the illuminated </p><p>table and listen to their conversation, to a certain extent </p><p>with their common permission, a situation quite different from what </p><p>had happened before.

of course, it was no longer the </p><p>animated social interaction of former times, which gregor in small </p><p>hotel rooms had always thought about with a certain longing, </p><p>when, tired out, he had had to throw himself into </p><p>the damp bedclothes. for the most part what went on </p><p>now was very quiet. after the evening meal, the father </p><p>fell asleep quickly in his arm chair. the mother and </p><p>sister talked guardedly to each other in the stillness. bent </p><p>far over, the mother sewed fine undergarments for a fashion </p><p>shop. the sister, who had taken on a job as </p><p>a salesgirl, in the evening studied stenography and french, so </p><p>as perhaps later to obtain a better position. sometimes the </p><p>father woke up and, as if he was quite ignorant </p><p>that he had been asleep, said to the mother  how </p><p>long you have been sewing today?  and went right back </p><p>to sleep, while the mother and the sister smiled tiredly </p><p>to each other.

with a sort of stubbornness the father </p><p>refused to take off his servant's uniform even at </p><p>home, and while his sleeping gown hung unused on the </p><p>coat hook, the father dozed completely dressed in his place, </p><p>as if he was always ready for his responsibility and </p><p>even here was waiting for the voice of his superior. </p><p>as a result, in spite of all the care of </p><p>the mother and sister, his uniform, which even at the </p><p>start was not new, grew dirty, and gregor looked, often </p><p>for the entire evening, at this clothing, with stains all </p><p>over it and with its gold buttons always polished, in </p><p>which the old man, although very uncomfortable, slept peacefully nonetheless.

</p><p>as soon as the clock struck ten, the mother tried </p><p>gently encouraging the father to wake up and then persuading </p><p>him to go to bed, on the ground that he </p><p>couldn't get a proper sleep here and that the </p><p>father, who had to report for service at six o'</p><p>clock, really needed a good sleep. but in his stubbornness, </p><p>which had gripped him since he had become a servant, </p><p>he insisted always on staying even longer by the table, </p><p>although he regularly fell asleep and then could only be </p><p>prevailed upon with the greatest difficulty to trade his chair </p><p>for the bed. no matter how much the mother and </p><p>sister might at that point work on him with small </p><p>admonitions, for a quarter of an hour he would remain </p><p>shaking his head slowly, his eyes closed, without standing up. </p><p>the mother would pull him by the sleeve and speak </p><p>flattering words into his ear; the sister would leave her </p><p>work to help her mother, but that would not have </p><p>the desired effect on the father. he would settle himself </p><p>even more deeply in his arm chair. only when the </p><p>two women grabbed him under the armpits would he throw </p><p>his eyes open, look back and forth at the mother </p><p>and sister, and habitually say  this is a life. this </p><p>is the peace and quiet of my old age.  and </p><p>propped up by both women, he would heave himself up </p><p>elaborately, as if for him it was the greatest trouble, </p><p>allow himself to be led to the door by the </p><p>women, wave them away there, and proceed on his own </p><p>from there, while the mother quickly threw down her sewing </p><p>implements and the sister her pen in order to run </p><p>after the father and help him some more.

in this </p><p>overworked and exhausted family who had time to worry any </p><p>longer about gregor more than was absolutely necessary? the household </p><p>was constantly getting smaller. the servant girl was now let </p><p>go. a huge bony cleaning woman with white hair flying </p><p>all over her head came in the morning and evening </p><p>to do the heaviest work. the mother took care of </p><p>everything else in addition to her considerable sewing work. it </p><p>even happened that various pieces of family jewellery, which previously </p><p>the mother and sister had been overjoyed to wear on </p><p>social and festive occasions, were sold, as gregor found out </p><p>in the evening from the general discussion of the prices </p><p>they had fetched. but the greatest complaint was always that </p><p>they could not leave this apartment, which was too big </p><p>for their present means, since it was impossible to imagine </p><p>how gregor might be moved. but gregor fully recognized that </p><p>it was not just consideration for him which was preventing </p><p>a move, for he could have been transported easily in </p><p>a suitable box with a few air holes. the main </p><p>thing holding the family back from a change in living </p><p>quarters was far more their complete hopelessness and the idea </p><p>that they had been struck by a misfortune like no </p><p>one else in their entire circle of relatives and acquaintances.

</p><p>what the world demands of poor people they now carried </p><p>out to an extreme degree. the father bought breakfast to </p><p>the petty officials at the bank, the mother sacrificed herself </p><p>for the undergarments of strangers, the sister behind her desk </p><p>was at the beck and call of customers, but the </p><p>family's energies did not extend any further. and the </p><p>wound in his back began to pain gregor all over </p><p>again, when now mother and sister, after they had escorted </p><p>the father to bed, came back, let their work lie, </p><p>moved close together, and sat cheek to cheek and when </p><p>his mother would now say, pointing to gregor's room,  </p><p>close the door, grete,  and when gregor was again in </p><p>the darkness, while close by the women mingled their tears </p><p>or, quite dry eyed, stared at the table.

gregor spent </p><p>his nights and days with hardly any sleep. sometimes he </p><p>thought that the next time the door opened he would </p><p>take over the family arrangements just as he had earlier. </p><p>in his imagination appeared again, after a long time, his </p><p>employer and supervisor and the apprentices, the excessively spineless custodian, </p><p>two or three friends from other businesses, a chambermaid from </p><p>a hotel in the provinces, a loving fleeting memory, a </p><p>female cashier from a hat shop, whom he had seriously </p><p>but too slowly courted--they all appeared mixed in with </p><p>strangers or people he had already forgotten, but instead of </p><p>helping him and his family, they were all unapproachable, and </p><p>he was happy to see them disappear.

but then he </p><p>was in no mood to worry about his family. he </p><p>was filled with sheer anger over the wretched care he </p><p>was getting, even though he couldn't imagine anything which </p><p>he might have an appetite for. still, he made plans </p><p>about how he could take from the larder what he </p><p>at all account deserved, even if he wasn't hungry. </p><p>without thinking any more about how they might be able </p><p>to give gregor special pleasure, the sister now kicked some </p><p>food or other very quickly into his room in the </p><p>morning and at noon, before she ran off to her </p><p>shop, and in the evening, quite indifferent to whether the </p><p>food had perhaps only been tasted or, what happened most </p><p>frequently, remained entirely undisturbed, she whisked it out with one </p><p>sweep of her broom. the task of cleaning his room, </p><p>which she now always carried out in the evening, could </p><p>not be done any more quickly. streaks of dirt ran </p><p>along the walls; here and there lay tangles of dust </p><p>and garbage. at first, when his sister arrived, gregor positioned </p><p>himself in a particularly filthy corner in order with this </p><p>posture to make something of a protest. but he could </p><p>have well stayed there for weeks without his sister's </p><p>changing her ways. in fact, she perceived the dirt as </p><p>much as he did, but she had decided just to </p><p>let it stay.

in this business, with a touchiness which </p><p>was quite new to her and which had generally taken </p><p>over the entire family, she kept watch to see that </p><p>the cleaning of gregor's room remained reserved for her. </p><p>once his mother had undertaken a major cleaning of gregor'</p><p>s room, which she had only completed successfully after using </p><p>a few buckets of water. but the extensive dampness made </p><p>gregor sick and he lay supine, embittered and immobile on </p><p>the couch. however, the mother's punishment was not delayed </p><p>for long. for in the evening the sister had hardly </p><p>observed the change in gregor's room before she ran </p><p>into the living room mightily offended and, in spite of </p><p>her mother's hand lifted high in entreaty, broke out </p><p>in a fit of crying. her parents—the father had, </p><p>of course, woken up with a start in his arm </p><p>chair—at first looked at her astonished and helpless, until </p><p>they started to get agitated. turning to his right, the </p><p>father heaped reproaches on the mother that she was not </p><p>to take over the cleaning of gregor's room from </p><p>the sister and, turning to his left, he shouted at </p><p>the sister that she would no longer be allowed to </p><p>clean gregor's room ever again, while the mother tried </p><p>to pull the father, beside himself in his excitement, into </p><p>the bed room. the sister, shaken by her crying fit, </p><p>pounded on the table with her tiny fists, and gregor </p><p>hissed at all this, angry that no one thought about </p><p>shutting the door and sparing him the sight of this </p><p>commotion.

but even when the sister, exhausted from her daily </p><p>work, had grown tired of caring for gregor as she </p><p>had before, even then the mother did not have to </p><p>come at all on her behalf. and gregor did not </p><p>have to be neglected. for now the cleaning woman was </p><p>there. this old widow, who in her long life must </p><p>have managed to survive the worst with the help of </p><p>her bony frame, had no real horror of gregor. without </p><p>being in the least curious, she had once by chance </p><p>opened gregor's door. at the sight of gregor, who, </p><p>totally surprised, began to scamper here and there, although no </p><p>one was chasing him, she remained standing with her hands </p><p>folded across her stomach staring at him. since then she </p><p>did not fail to open the door furtively a little </p><p>every morning and evening to look in on gregor. at </p><p>first, she also called him to her with words which </p><p>she presumably thought were friendly, like  come here for a </p><p>bit, old dung beetle!  or  hey, look at the old </p><p>dung beetle!  addressed in such a manner, gregor answered nothing, </p><p>but remained motionless in his place, as if the door </p><p>had not been opened at all. if only, instead of </p><p>allowing this cleaning woman to disturb him uselessly whenever she </p><p>felt like it, they had given her orders to clean </p><p>up his room every day! one day in the early </p><p>morning—a hard downpour, perhaps already a sign of the </p><p>coming spring, struck the window panes—when the cleaning woman </p><p>started up once again with her usual conversation, gregor was </p><p>so bitter that he turned towards her, as if for </p><p>an attack, although slowly and weakly. but instead of being </p><p>afraid of him, the cleaning woman merely lifted up a </p><p>chair standing close by the door and, as she stood </p><p>there with her mouth wide open, her intention was clear: </p><p>she would close her mouth only when the chair in </p><p>her hand had been thrown down on gregor's back.  </p><p>this goes no further, all right?  she asked, as gregor </p><p>turned himself around again, and she placed the chair calmly </p><p>back in the corner.

gregor ate hardly anything any more. </p><p>only when he chanced to move past the food which </p><p>had been prepared did he, as a game, take a </p><p>bit into his mouth, hold it there for hours, and </p><p>generally spit it out again. at first he thought it </p><p>might be his sadness over the condition of his room </p><p>which kept him from eating, but he very soon became </p><p>reconciled to the alterations in his room. people had grown </p><p>accustomed to put into storage in his room things which </p><p>they couldn't put anywhere else, and at this point </p><p>there were many such things, now that they had rented </p><p>one room of the apartment to three lodgers. these solemn </p><p>gentlemen—all three had full beards, as gregor once found </p><p>out through a crack in the door—were meticulously intent </p><p>on tidiness, not only in their own room but, since </p><p>they had now rented a room here, in the entire </p><p>household, and particularly in the kitchen. they simply did not </p><p>tolerate any useless or shoddy stuff. moreover, for the most </p><p>part they had brought with them their own pieces of </p><p>furniture. thus, many items had become superfluous, and these were </p><p>not really things one could sell or things people wanted </p><p>to throw out. all these items ended up in gregor'</p><p>s room, even the box of ashes and the garbage </p><p>pail from the kitchen. the cleaning woman, always in a </p><p>hurry, simply flung anything that was momentarily useless into gregor'</p><p>s room. fortunately gregor generally saw only the relevant object </p><p>and the hand which held it. the cleaning woman perhaps </p><p>was intending, when time and opportunity allowed, to take the </p><p>stuff out again or to throw everything out all at </p><p>once, but in fact the things remained lying there, wherever </p><p>they had ended up at the first throw, unless gregor </p><p>squirmed his way through the accumulation of junk and moved </p><p>it. at first he was forced to do this because </p><p>otherwise there was no room for him to creep around, </p><p>but later he did it with a growing pleasure, although </p><p>after such movements, tired to death and feeling wretched, he </p><p>didn't budge for hours.

because the lodgers sometimes also </p><p>took their evening meal at home in the common living </p><p>room, the door to the living room stayed shut on </p><p>many evenings. but gregor had no trouble at all going </p><p>without the open door. already on many evenings when it </p><p>was open he had not availed himself of it, but, </p><p>without the family noticing, was stretched out in the darkest </p><p>corner of his room. however, once the cleaning woman had </p><p>left the door to the living room slightly ajar, and </p><p>it remained open even when the lodgers came in in </p><p>the evening and the lights were put on. they sat </p><p>down at the head of the table, where in earlier </p><p>days the mother, the father, and gregor had eaten, unfolded </p><p>their serviettes, and picked up their knives and forks. the </p><p>mother immediately appeared in the door with a dish of </p><p>meat and right behind her the sister with a dish </p><p>piled high with potatoes. the food gave off a lot </p><p>of steam. the gentlemen lodgers bent over the plate set </p><p>before them, as if they wanted to check it before </p><p>eating, and in fact the one who sat in the </p><p>middle—for the other two he seemed to serve as </p><p>the authority—cut off a piece of meat still on </p><p>the plate obviously to establish whether it was sufficiently tender </p><p>and whether or not something should be shipped back to </p><p>the kitchen. he was satisfied, and mother and sister, who </p><p>had looked on in suspense, began to breathe easily and </p><p>to smile.

the family itself ate in the kitchen. in </p><p>spite of that, before the father went into the kitchen, </p><p>he came into the room and with a single bow, </p><p>cap in hand, made a tour of the table. the </p><p>lodgers rose up collectively and murmured something in their beards. </p><p>then, when they were alone, they ate almost in complete </p><p>silence. it seemed odd to gregor that, out of all </p><p>the many different sorts of sounds of eating, what was </p><p>always audible was their chewing teeth, as if by that </p><p>gregor should be shown that people needed their teeth to </p><p>eat and that nothing could be done even with the </p><p>most handsome toothless jawbone.  i really do have an appetite,  </p><p>gregor said to himself sorrowfully,  but not for these things. </p><p>how these lodgers stuff themselves, and i am dying. 

on </p><p>this very evening the violin sounded from the kitchen. gregor </p><p>didn't remember hearing it all through this period. the </p><p>lodgers had already ended their night meal, the middle one </p><p>had pulled out a newspaper and had given each of </p><p>the other two a page, and they were now leaning </p><p>back, reading and smoking. when the violin started playing, they </p><p>became attentive, got up, and went on tiptoe to the </p><p>hall door, at which they remained standing pressed up against </p><p>one another. they must have been audible from the kitchen, </p><p>because the father called out  perhaps the gentlemen don't </p><p>like the playing? it can be stopped at once.   on </p><p>the contrary,  stated the lodger in the middle,  might the </p><p>young woman not come into us and play in the </p><p>room here, where it is really much more comfortable and </p><p>cheerful?   oh, thank you,  cried out the father, as if </p><p>he were the one playing the violin. the men stepped </p><p>back into the room and waited. soon the father came </p><p>with the music stand, the mother with the sheet music, </p><p>and the sister with the violin. the sister calmly prepared </p><p>everything for the recital. the parents, who had never previously </p><p>rented a room and therefore exaggerated their politeness to the </p><p>lodgers, dared not sit on their own chairs. the father </p><p>leaned against the door, his right hand stuck between two </p><p>buttons of his buttoned-up uniform. the mother, however, accepted </p><p>a chair offered by one lodger. since she left the </p><p>chair sit where the gentleman had chanced to put it, </p><p>she sat to one side in a corner.

the sister </p><p>began to play. the father and mother, one on each </p><p>side, followed attentively the movements of her hands. attracted by </p><p>the playing, gregor had ventured to advance a little further </p><p>forward and his head was already in the living room. </p><p>he scarcely wondered about the fact that recently he had </p><p>had so little consideration for the others. earlier this consideration </p><p>had been something he was proud of. and for that </p><p>very reason he would have had at this moment more </p><p>reason to hide away, because as a result of the </p><p>dust which lay all over his room and flew around </p><p>with the slightest movement, he was totally covered in dirt. </p><p>on his back and his sides he carted around with </p><p>him dust, threads, hair, and remnants of food. his indifference </p><p>to everything was much too great for him to lie </p><p>on his back and scour himself on the carpet, as </p><p>he often had done earlier during the day. in spite </p><p>of his condition he had no timidity about inching forward </p><p>a bit on the spotless floor of the living room.

</p><p>in any case, no one paid him any attention. the </p><p>family was all caught up in the violin playing. the </p><p>lodgers, by contrast, who for the moment had placed themselves, </p><p>hands in their trouser pockets, behind the music stand much </p><p>too close to the sister, so that they could all </p><p>see the sheet music, something that must certainly bother the </p><p>sister, soon drew back to the window conversing in low </p><p>voices with bowed heads, where they then remained, worriedly observed </p><p>by the father. it now seemed really clear that, having </p><p>assumed they were to hear a beautiful or entertaining violin </p><p>recital, they were disappointed and were allowing their peace and </p><p>quiet to be disturbed only out of politeness. the way </p><p>in which they all blew the smoke from their cigars </p><p>out of their noses and mouths in particular led one </p><p>to conclude that they were very irritated. and yet his </p><p>sister was playing so beautifully. her face was turned to </p><p>the side, her gaze followed the score intently and sadly. </p><p>gregor crept forward still a little further, keeping his head </p><p>close against the floor in order to be able to </p><p>catch her gaze if possible. was he an animal that </p><p>music so captivated him? for him it was as if </p><p>the way to the unknown nourishment he craved was revealing </p><p>itself. he was determined to press forward right to his </p><p>sister, to tug at her dress, and to indicate to </p><p>her in this way that she might still come with </p><p>her violin into his room, because here no one valued </p><p>the recital as he wanted to value it. he did </p><p>not wish to let her go from his room any </p><p>more, at least not as long as he lived. his </p><p>frightening appearance would for the first time become useful for </p><p>him. he wanted to be at all the doors of </p><p>his room simultaneously and snarl back at the attackers. however, </p><p>his sister should not be compelled but would remain with </p><p>him voluntarily. she would sit next to him on the </p><p>sofa, bend down her ear to him, and he would </p><p>then confide in her that he firmly intended to send </p><p>her to the conservatory and that, if his misfortune had </p><p>not arrived in the interim, he would have declared all </p><p>this last christmas—had christmas really already come and gone?—</p><p>and would have brooked no argument. after this explanation his </p><p>sister would break out in tears of emotion, and gregor </p><p>would lift himself up to her armpit and kiss her </p><p>throat, which she, from the time she started going to </p><p>work, had left exposed without a band or a collar.

 </p><p>mr. samsa,  called out the middle lodger to the father </p><p>and, without uttering a further word, pointed his index finger </p><p>at gregor as he was moving slowly forward. the violin </p><p>fell silent. the middle lodger smiled, first shaking his head </p><p>once at his friends, and then looked down at gregor </p><p>once more. rather than driving gregor back again, the father </p><p>seemed to consider it of prime importance to calm down </p><p>the lodgers, although they were not at all upset and </p><p>gregor seemed to entertain them more than the violin recital. </p><p>the father hurried over to them and with outstretched arms </p><p>tried to push them into their own room and simultaneously </p><p>to block their view of gregor with his own body. </p><p>at this point they became really somewhat irritated, although one </p><p>no longer knew whether that was because of the father'</p><p>s behaviour or because of knowledge they had just acquired </p><p>that they had, without knowing it, a neighbour like gregor. </p><p>they demanded explanations from his father, raised their arms to </p><p>make their points, tugged agitatedly at their beards, and moved </p><p>back towards their room quite slowly. in the meantime, the </p><p>isolation which had suddenly fallen upon his sister after the </p><p>sudden breaking off of the recital had overwhelmed her. she </p><p>had held onto the violin and bow in her limp </p><p>hands for a little while and had continued to look </p><p>at the sheet music as if she was still playing. </p><p>all at once she pulled herself together, placed the instrument </p><p>in her mother's lap—the mother was still sitting </p><p>in her chair having trouble breathing for her lungs were </p><p>labouring—and had run into the next room, which the </p><p>lodgers, pressured by the father, were already approaching more rapidly. </p><p>one could observe how under the sister's practiced hands </p><p>the sheets and pillows on the beds were thrown on </p><p>high and arranged. even before the lodgers had reached the </p><p>room, she was finished fixing the beds and was slipping </p><p>out. the father seemed so gripped once again with his </p><p>stubbornness that he forgot about the respect which he always </p><p>owed to his renters. he pressed on and on, until </p><p>at the door of the room the middle gentleman stamped </p><p>loudly with his foot and thus brought the father to </p><p>a standstill.  i hereby declare,  the middle lodger said, raising </p><p>his hand and casting his glance both on the mother </p><p>and the sister,  that considering the disgraceful conditions prevailing in </p><p>this apartment and family —with this he spat decisively on </p><p>the floor— i immediately cancel my room. i will, of </p><p>course, pay nothing at all for the days which i </p><p>have lived here; on the contrary i shall think about </p><p>whether or not i will initiate some sort of action </p><p>against you, something which—believe me—will be very easy </p><p>to establish.  he fell silent and looked directly in front </p><p>of him, as if he was waiting for something. in </p><p>fact, his two friends immediately joined in with their opinions,  </p><p>we also give immediate notice.  at that he seized the </p><p>door handle, banged the door shut, and locked it.

the </p><p>father groped his way tottering to his chair and let </p><p>himself fall in it. it looked as if he was </p><p>stretching out for his usual evening snooze, but the heavy </p><p>nodding of his head, which looked as if it was </p><p>without support, showed that he was not sleeping at all. </p><p>gregor had lain motionless the entire time in the spot </p><p>where the lodgers had caught him. disappointment with the collapse </p><p>of his plan and perhaps also weakness brought on by </p><p>his severe hunger made it impossible for him to move. </p><p>he was certainly afraid that a general disaster would break </p><p>over him at any moment, and he waited. he was </p><p>not even startled when the violin fell from the mother'</p><p>s lap, out from under her trembling fingers, and gave </p><p>off a reverberating tone.

 my dear parents,  said the sister </p><p>banging her hand on the table by way of an </p><p>introduction,  things cannot go on any longer in this way. </p><p>maybe if you don't understand that, well, i do. </p><p>i will not utter my brother's name in front </p><p>of this monster, and thus i say only that we </p><p>must try to get rid of it. we have tried </p><p>what is humanly possible to take care of it and </p><p>to be patient. i believe that no one can criticize </p><p>us in the slightest.   she is right in a thousand </p><p>ways,  said the father to himself. the mother, who was </p><p>still incapable of breathing properly, began to cough numbly with </p><p>her hand held up over her mouth and a manic </p><p>expression in her eyes.

the sister hurried over to her </p><p>mother and held her forehead. the sister's words seemed </p><p>to have led the father to certain reflections. he sat </p><p>upright, played with his uniform hat among the plates, which </p><p>still lay on the table from the lodgers' evening meal, </p><p>and looked now and then at the motionless gregor.

 we </p><p>must try to get rid of it,  the sister now </p><p>said decisively to the father, for the mother, in her </p><p>coughing fit, was not listening to anything.  it is killing </p><p>you both. i see it coming. when people have to </p><p>work as hard as we all do, they cannot also </p><p>tolerate this endless torment at home. i just can't </p><p>go on any more.  and she broke out into such </p><p>a crying fit that her tears flowed out down onto </p><p>her mother's face. she wiped them off her mother </p><p>with mechanical motions of her hands.

 child,  said the father </p><p>sympathetically and with obvious appreciation,  then what should we do? 

</p><p>the sister only shrugged her shoulders as a sign of </p><p>the perplexity which, in contrast to her previous confidence, had </p><p>come over her while she was crying.

 if only he </p><p>understood us,  said the father in a semi-questioning tone. </p><p>the sister, in the midst of her sobbing, shook her </p><p>hand energetically as a sign that there was no point </p><p>thinking of that.

 if he only understood us,  repeated the </p><p>father and by shutting his eyes he absorbed the sister'</p><p>s conviction of the impossibility of this point,  then perhaps </p><p>some compromise would be possible with him. but as it </p><p>is. . . 

 it must be gotten rid of,  cried the sister.  </p><p>that is the only way, father. you must try to </p><p>get rid of the idea that this is gregor. the </p><p>fact that we have believed for so long, that is </p><p>truly our real misfortune. but how can it be gregor? </p><p>if it were gregor, he would have long ago realized </p><p>that a communal life among human beings is not possible </p><p>with such an animal and would have gone away voluntarily. </p><p>then we would not have a brother, but we could </p><p>go on living and honour his memory. but this animal </p><p>plagues us. it drives away the lodgers, will obviously take </p><p>over the entire apartment, and leave us to spend the </p><p>night in the alley. just look, father,  she suddenly cried </p><p>out,  he's already starting up again.  with a fright </p><p>which was totally incomprehensible to gregor, the sister even left </p><p>the mother, pushed herself away from her chair, as if </p><p>she would sooner sacrifice her mother than remain in gregor'</p><p>s vicinity, and rushed behind her father who, excited merely </p><p>by her behaviour, also stood up and half raised his </p><p>arms in front of the sister as though to protect </p><p>her.

but gregor did not have any notion of wishing </p><p>to create problems for anyone and certainly not for his </p><p>sister. he had just started to turn himself around in </p><p>order to creep back into his room, quite a startling </p><p>sight, since, as a result of his suffering condition, he </p><p>had to guide himself through the difficulty of turning around </p><p>with his head, in this process lifting and banging it </p><p>against the floor several times. he paused and looked around. </p><p>his good intentions seem to have been recognized. the fright </p><p>had lasted only for a moment. now they looked at </p><p>him in silence and sorrow. his mother lay in her </p><p>chair, with her legs stretched out and pressed together; her </p><p>eyes were almost shut from weariness. the father and sister </p><p>sat next to one another. the sister had set her </p><p>hands around the father's neck.

 now perhaps i can </p><p>actually turn myself around,  thought gregor and began the task </p><p>again. he couldn't stop puffing at the effort and </p><p>had to rest now and then.

besides, no one was </p><p>urging him on. it was all left to him on </p><p>his own. when he had completed turning around, he immediately </p><p>began to wander straight back. he was astonished at the </p><p>great distance which separated him from his room and did </p><p>not understand in the least how in his weakness he </p><p>had covered the same distance a short time before, almost </p><p>without noticing it. constantly intent only on creeping along quickly, </p><p>he hardly paid any attention to the fact that no </p><p>word or cry from his family interrupted him.

only when </p><p>he was already in the door did he turn his </p><p>head, not completely, because he felt his neck growing stiff. </p><p>at any rate he still saw that behind him nothing </p><p>had changed. only the sister was standing up. his last </p><p>glimpse brushed over the mother who was now completely asleep. </p><p>hardly was he inside his room when the door was </p><p>pushed shut very quickly, bolted fast, and barred. gregor was </p><p>startled by the sudden commotion behind him, so much so </p><p>that his little limbs bent double under him. it was </p><p>his sister who had been in such a hurry. she </p><p>had stood up right away, had waited, and had then </p><p>sprung forward nimbly. gregor had not heard anything of her </p><p>approach. she cried out  finally!  to her parents, as she </p><p>turned the key in the lock.

 what now?  gregor asked </p><p>himself and looked around him in the darkness. he soon </p><p>made the discovery that he could no longer move at </p><p>all. he was not surprised at that. on the contrary, </p><p>it struck him as unnatural that up to this point </p><p>he had really been able up to move around with </p><p>these thin little legs. besides he felt relatively content. true, </p><p>he had pains throughout his entire body, but it seemed </p><p>to him that they were gradually becoming weaker and weaker </p><p>and would finally go away completely. the rotten apple in </p><p>his back and the inflamed surrounding area, entirely covered with </p><p>white dust, he hardly noticed. he remembered his family with </p><p>deep feelings of love. in this business, his own thought </p><p>that he had to disappear was, if possible, even more </p><p>decisive than his sister's. he remained in this state </p><p>of empty and peaceful reflection until the tower clock struck </p><p>three o'clock in the morning. from the window he </p><p>witnessed the beginning of the general dawning outside. then without </p><p>willing it, his head sank all the way down, and </p><p>from his nostrils flowed out weakly his last breath.

early </p><p>in the morning the cleaning woman came. in her sheer </p><p>energy and haste she banged all the doors—in precisely </p><p>the way people had already asked her to avoid—so </p><p>much so that once she arrived a quiet sleep was </p><p>no longer possible anywhere in the entire apartment. in her </p><p>customarily brief visit to gregor she at first found nothing </p><p>special. she thought he lay so immobile there because he </p><p>wanted to play the offended party. she gave him credit </p><p>for as complete an understanding as possible. since she happened </p><p>to be holding the long broom in her hand, she </p><p>tried to tickle gregor with it from the door. when </p><p>that was quite unsuccessful, she became irritated and poked gregor </p><p>a little, and only when she had shoved him from </p><p>his place without any resistance did she become attentive. when </p><p>she quickly realized the true state of affairs, her eyes </p><p>grew large, she whistled to herself. however, she didn't </p><p>restrain herself for long. she pulled open the door of </p><p>the bedroom and yelled in a loud voice into the </p><p>darkness,  come and look. it's kicked the bucket. it'</p><p>s lying there, totally snuffed! 

the samsa married couple sat </p><p>upright in their marriage bed and had to get over </p><p>their fright at the cleaning woman before they managed to </p><p>grasp her message. but then mr. and mrs. samsa climbed </p><p>very quickly out of bed, one on either side. mr. </p><p>samsa threw the bedspread over his shoulders, mrs. samsa came </p><p>out only in her night-shirt, and like this they </p><p>stepped into gregor's room. meanwhile, the door of the </p><p>living room, in which grete had slept since the lodgers </p><p>had arrived on the scene, had also opened. she was </p><p>fully clothed, as if she had not slept at all; </p><p>her white face also seem to indicate that.  dead?  said </p><p>mrs. samsa and looked questioningly at the cleaning woman, although </p><p>she could check everything on her own and even understand </p><p>without a check.  i should say so,  said the cleaning </p><p>woman and, by way of proof, poked gregor's body </p><p>with the broom a considerable distance more to the side. </p><p>mrs. samsa made a movement as if she wished to </p><p>restrain the broom, but didn't do it.  well,  said </p><p>mr. samsa,  now we can give thanks to god.  he </p><p>crossed himself, and the three women followed his example.

grete, </p><p>who did not take her eyes off the corpse, said,  </p><p>look how thin he was. he had eaten nothing for </p><p>such a long time. the meals which came in here </p><p>came out again exactly the same.  in fact, gregor's </p><p>body was completely flat and dry. that was apparent really </p><p>for the first time, now that he was no longer </p><p>raised on his small limbs and nothing else distracted one'</p><p>s gaze.

 grete, come into us for a moment,  said </p><p>mrs. samsa with a melancholy smile, and grete went, not </p><p>without looking back at the corpse, behind her parents into </p><p>the bed room. the cleaning woman shut the door and </p><p>opened the window wide. in spite of the early morning, </p><p>the fresh air was partly tinged with warmth. it was </p><p>already the end of march.

the three lodgers stepped out </p><p>of their room and looked around for their breakfast, astonished </p><p>that they had been forgotten.  where is the breakfast?  asked </p><p>the middle one of the gentlemen grumpily to the cleaning </p><p>woman. however, she laid her finger to her lips and </p><p>then quickly and silently indicated to the lodgers that they </p><p>could come into gregor's room. so they came and </p><p>stood in the room, which was already quite bright, around </p><p>gregor's corpse, their hands in the pockets of their </p><p>somewhat worn jackets.

then the door of the bed room </p><p>opened, and mr. samsa appeared in his uniform, with his </p><p>wife on one arm and his daughter on the other. </p><p>all were a little tear stained. now and then grete </p><p>pressed her face onto her father's arm.

 get out </p><p>of my apartment immediately,  said mr. samsa and pulled open </p><p>the door, without letting go of the women.  what do </p><p>you mean?  said the middle lodger, somewhat dismayed and with </p><p>a sugary smile. the two others kept their hands behind </p><p>them and constantly rubbed them against each other, as if </p><p>in joyful anticipation of a great squabble which must end </p><p>up in their favour.  i mean exactly what i say,  </p><p>replied mr. samsa and went directly with his two female </p><p>companions up to the lodger. the latter at first stood </p><p>there motionless and looked at the floor, as if matters </p><p>were arranging themselves in a new way in his head.  </p><p>all right, then we'll go,  he said and looked </p><p>up at mr. samsa as if, suddenly overcome by humility, </p><p>he was asking fresh permission for this decision. mr. samsa </p><p>merely nodded to him repeatedly with his eyes open wide.

</p><p>following that, the lodger actually went with long strides immediately </p><p>out into the hall. his two friends had already been </p><p>listening for a while with their hands quite still, and </p><p>now they hopped smartly after him, as if afraid that </p><p>mr. samsa could step into the hall ahead of them </p><p>and disturb their reunion with their leader. in the hall </p><p>all three of them took their hats from the coat </p><p>rack, pulled their canes from the cane holder, bowed silently, </p><p>and left the apartment. in what turned out to be </p><p>an entirely groundless mistrust, mr. samsa stepped with the two </p><p>women out onto the landing, leaned against the railing, and </p><p>looked over as the three lodgers slowly but steadily made </p><p>their way down the long staircase, disappeared on each floor </p><p>in a certain turn of the stairwell, and in a </p><p>few seconds came out again. the deeper they proceeded, the </p><p>more the samsa family lost interest in them, and when </p><p>a butcher with a tray on his head come to </p><p>meet them and then with a proud bearing ascended the </p><p>stairs high above them, mr. samsa., together with the women, </p><p>left the banister, and they all returned, as if relieved, </p><p>back into their apartment.

they decided to pass that day </p><p>resting and going for a stroll. not only had they </p><p>earned this break from work, but there was no question </p><p>that they really needed it. and so they sat down </p><p>at the table and wrote three letters of apology: mr. </p><p>samsa to his supervisor, mrs. samsa to her client, and </p><p>grete to her proprietor. during the writing the cleaning woman </p><p>came in to say that she was going off, for </p><p>her morning work was finished. the three people writing at </p><p>first merely nodded, without glancing up. only when the cleaning </p><p>woman was still unwilling to depart, did they look up </p><p>angrily.  well?  asked mr. samsa. the cleaning woman stood smiling </p><p>in the doorway, as if she had a great stroke </p><p>of luck to report to the family but would only </p><p>do it if she was asked directly. the almost upright </p><p>small ostrich feather in her hat, which had irritated mr. </p><p>samsa during her entire service, swayed lightly in all directions.  </p><p>all right then, what do you really want?  asked mrs. </p><p>samsa, whom the cleaning lady still usually respected.  well,  answered </p><p>the cleaning woman, smiling so happily she couldn't go </p><p>on speaking right away,  about how that rubbish from the </p><p>next room should be thrown out, you mustn't worry </p><p>about it. it's all taken care of.  mrs. samsa </p><p>and grete bent down to their letters, as though they </p><p>wanted to go on writing. mr. samsa, who noticed that </p><p>the cleaning woman wanted to start describing everything in detail, </p><p>decisively prevented her with an outstretched hand. but since she </p><p>was not allowed to explain, she remembered the great hurry </p><p>she was in, and called out, clearly insulted,  bye bye, </p><p>everyone,  turned around furiously and left the apartment with a </p><p>fearful slamming of the door.

 this evening she'll be </p><p>let go,  said mr. samsa, but he got no answer </p><p>from either his wife or from his daughter, because the </p><p>cleaning woman seemed to have upset once again the tranquillity </p><p>they had just attained. they got up, went to the </p><p>window, and remained there, with their arms about each other. </p><p>mr. samsa turned around in his chair in their direction </p><p>and observed them quietly for a while. then he called </p><p>out,  all right, come here then. let's finally get </p><p>rid of old things. and have a little consideration for </p><p>me.  the women attended to him at once. they rushed </p><p>to him, caressed him, and quickly ended their letters.

then </p><p>all three left the apartment together, something they had not </p><p>done for months now, and took the electric tram into </p><p>the open air outside the city. the car in which </p><p>they were sitting by themselves was totally engulfed by the </p><p>warm sun. leaning back comfortably in their seats, they talked </p><p>to each other about future prospects, and they discovered that </p><p>on closer observation these were not at all bad, for </p><p>the three of them had employment, about which they had </p><p>not really questioned each other at all, which was extremely </p><p>favourable and with especially promising prospects. the greatest improvement in </p><p>their situation at this moment, of course, had to come </p><p>from a change of dwelling. now they wanted to rent </p><p>an apartment smaller and cheaper but better situated and generally </p><p>more practical than the present one, which gregor had found. </p><p>while they amused themselves in this way, it struck mr. </p><p>and mrs. samsa, almost at the same moment, how their </p><p>daughter, who was getting more animated all the time, had </p><p>blossomed recently, in spite of all the troubles which had </p><p>made her cheeks pale, into a beautiful and voluptuous young </p><p>woman. growing more silent and almost unconsciously understanding each other </p><p>in their glances, they thought that the time was now </p><p>at hand to seek out a good honest man for </p><p>her. and it was something of a confirmation of their </p><p>new dreams and good intentions when at the end of </p><p>their journey their daughter got up first and stretched her </p>young body.
